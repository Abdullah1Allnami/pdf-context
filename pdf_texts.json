1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 POLICY AND STRATEGY :  ENDS – WAYS – MEANS  \nCOMPETITION AND CONFLICT  \n1.1. National Security :  Kuwait’s national security originates both from national \nsovereignty, articulated and explained in Kuwait’s Constitution, and national interests. The \nfirst duty of the Amir of Kuwait and his Government is to maintain the freedom and integrity \nof the State and human security of the population, within the principles of Islam.  The Amir’s oath of office states:  \n “I swear by Almighty God to respect the Constitution and the laws of the State, to defend the \nliberties, interests, and properties of the people, and to safeguard the independence and \nterritorial integrity of the Country”\n1. \nKuwait’s national security includes the safety of the state and protecting it from external and \ninternal threats.  External threats may include invasion, attack or blockade.  Internal threats \nmay include terrorism, subversion, civil disorder, criminality, insurgency, sabotage and espionage.  Other threats include instability caused by financial crisis, climatic events, cyber \nor other forms of attack on critical national infrastructure and the possibility of pandemic disease affecting the population.  \n1.2. National Interest :  It is not the role of the Armed Forces to define national interest, \nthat is the responsibility of the Amir and Kuwait Government.  Kuwait’s national interest will seek to secure a range of broader interests – political, economic and social – that contribut e \nto the nation’s strength and prosperity and human security.  Such interests are interconnected and mutually supporting.  Without security and the ability of the Kuwaiti people to live their lives freely, the foundations of prosperity would be undermined. \n1.3. Government  Policy :  Kuwait’s chosen political outcomes, endstate and objectives \nare articulated in the Government’s national policy.  Policy articulates a choice leading to a \ncourse of action proposed or adopted by the government.  The Amir, Prime Minister, Cabinet \nand National Assembly are responsible for the Kuwait’s national policy. The government’s political intentions are articulated as a national strategic vision, aim or endstate, supported \nby strategic objectives.  Policy will be reviewed and renewed periodically as needed.  \n1.4. Kuwait Government ’s (National) Strategy:  National strategy defines, secures and \nadvances the nation’s long- term, enduring core interests and aims over time. Generally, \naims are based on security and prosperity.  National strategy coordinates the instruments of \nKuwait’s national power (Diplomatic - Information – Military – Economic) in pursuit of national \npolicy aims and objectives to secure Kuwait’s interests.  Formulating and executing national strategy is changeable and repeating circular activity.  Unexpected events and crises may \nalso radically change national strategy, requiring the military to operate outside of previous planning assumptions and Defence policy .  Kuwait will use a mixture of hard and soft power \nto influence other nations and secure their own aims. The balance of how they project their hard and soft power reflects the overall attitude of the nation. Descriptions of soft and hard \npower are below.  \n• Hard power . Hard power uses military and economic strength,\ncomplemented by diplomacy and information, to effectively influence actors or to\ndirectly change the course of events. Actors use hard power to attract, deter and\ncompel.\n• Soft power . Soft power is the ability to persuade or encourage others t\no\nadopt\n an alternative approach, primarily through cultural and ideological means or by\nencouraging emulation. Soft power is generally slower and more difficult to employ i n\n1 The Constitution of the State of Kuwait, 1962, Article 60, the Amir’s Oath of Office.  \nSERIAL 1 -01-01 \n1–01–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 a targeted way. Much of the process also lies outside a state’s control. Therefore, \napplying soft power demands: a campaign mindset; clear, consistent communication \nstrategies and measures of effectiveness; and a developed understanding of the \nintended audience and their societal attitudes and cultures. Diplomatic and \ninformation capabilities underpin soft power's effe ctiveness. \n1.5. Instruments  of National Power : DIME  – Diplomatic  – Information – Military  – \nEconomic.  \n• The Diploma tic Instrument.  I s about managing international relations to\nfurther national interests.  Successful diplomacy depends upon the power ofpersuasive negotiation, reinforced by capable and credible hard power (both military\nand economic).  Diplomacy is enhanced by a combination of reputation and integrity,\nthe skilful interplay of the other instruments of power and effective communication\n.\n• T\nhe Information Instrument . All States  operate in an informati on\nenv\nironment that has seen an exponential growth in information processing, data and\ndigital connectivity. The classification of information as a discrete instrument of power\nrecognizes audience centrality, public perception and information’s influenc e on\ndec\nision- makers. The information instrument often competes via narratives.\nNarratives are important because they give meaning to facts for audiences.\nNarratives are also used to align a nation’s actions across all the instruments of\npower.\n• The Military  Instrument . The priority of any national strategy is to defend t he\ns\ntate.  Military activities supporting national strategy and objectives can range from\ndeterrence and coercion through to applying force to counter a specific threat .\n• T\nhe Economic Instrument . The economic instrument is an influential har d\nand s\noft power tool, especially when used below the threshold of armed conflict. In  a\ngl\nobalized world, nations are attracted to economic alliances to gain an economic\nadvantage.\n1.6. Military Strategy .  Military Strategy constitutes the Military’s overall contribution to \nnational strategy and is a subset of it.  Military strategy is fundamentally about choices. It \nuses ends, ways and means to create a roadmap between the present and a desired future \nstate or condition, using military power, while providing flexible options on how best to arrive \nthere, expressed in coherent and clear terms . \n1.\n7. Ends, Ways & Means  (+ Risk) . In its simplest expression, strategy must balance the \napplication of ends (end state and objectives), ways (broad approaches) , means (resources)  \nand the level of risk deemed acceptable to achieve it. Having decided on the strategic ends \nand the role of the military force in achieving them, the ways through which the ends may be \nFigure 1-1 Illustrating the relationship between policy & strategy.  \nSERIAL 1 -01-01 \n1–01–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 achieved are discerned and elected, and then the means are allocated. Logical thinking \nmust be applied to ensure the means and ways are orchestrated to achieve the ends.  \n• Ends – t he military objectives that must be achieved in the operational are a\nt\no meet the endstate.\n• Means – what military capabilities resources are available to support the\noperation and should be applied; and how will these be integrated with the non-\nmilitary activities?\n• Ways – what sequence of actions is most likely to create the required effects;\nwhat approach will establish them; which instruments of power combine within these\napproaches; and how should actions be sequenced in time and space to achiev e\nt\nhem?\n• Risk – what is the probability and implications of an activity or event, and how\nmight it be managed or mitigated by scaling down ‘ends’ increasing ‘means’ or t he\nus\ne of ‘novel ways’ .\nUnderstanding Conflict – The Conflict Triangle  (AJP- 01) \n1.8. Understanding the causes of conflict underpins the ability to de- escalate and resolve \ndisputes. There are three fundamental causes of conflict, as illustrated in Figure 1.2 and explained below.  \n• Contradiction  is a\nn\ni\nssue over which conflicti ng\nbel\niefs and aims exist an d\nt\nhere might  be\ndi\nsagreement.\n• Attitude of t he\nact\nors – the perception of \nactors is shaped by their \nemotions, judgements and \ndesires towards the \ncontradiction, combined with \ntheir perceived advantage \nrelative to a competitor. Whether the perception is accurate or not is immaterial; neither is the merit of the contradiction. What matters is how actors perceive things, \nand what their beliefs are.  \n• Behaviour  that arises from attitudes and beliefs in a contradiction.\n1.9. The three elements of the conflict triangle interrelate and any one of them may be the \norigin for increased hostility between competitors.  \nContinuum of C ompetition (AJP- 01) \n1.10.  The continuum of competition is a model depicting how attitudes and behaviours \nshape international relations. The continuum depicts four types of relationships between states/groups of people: cooperation, rivalry, confrontation and armed conflict. The \nboundaries between cooperation, rivalry and confrontation, and the threshold between \nconfrontation and armed conflict, are complex and dynamic; the progression between each \nis neither linear nor easily defined. Interstate relations are typically sectoral: two  or more \nstates may cooperate in one sector and be in confrontation in another. The continuum is \ndescribed and illustrated in Figure 1. 3 below . \n• Cooperation . Cooperation occurs when states or non- state actors wor\nk\nt\nogether to achieve the same objectives. Often this occurs when actors’ attitudes  onConflict\nAttitudeContradictionBehaviour\nFigure 1.2 The Conflict Triangle\nSERIAL 1 -01-01 \n1–01–01 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 a contradiction align. The GCC  is an example of cooperation to protect and defend \nmember states' security. Cooperation provides the ideal basis for enduring stability.  \n \nFigure 1. 3 The Continuum of Competition  \n• Rivalry . Rivals exist in a state of peace but have conflicting aims or \ncontradictions. The actors compete with an attitude or behaviour in accordance with \nthe rules -based international order (RBIO). The RBIO is a shared commitment by all \ncountries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules that evolve over time through multinationally agreed processes. Rivalry is not necessar ily negative, it \nis the normal state in international relations, and when it exists within the RBIO \nframework it can be beneficial to all parties and the international system.  \n• \nConfrontation. Confrontation occurs when differences have not been \nreconciled and adversaries oppose each other with hostile intent or behaviour \nsuch that a state of crisis develops. Adversaries use hostile behaviour or \nattitudes, including posturing, threats and perhaps  violence, as a competitive tool \nto resolve the contradictions in their favour. There is no defined threshold that separates confrontation from armed conflict because many actors intentionally try \nto obscure or confuse exactly where this thr eshold lies. \n \n• Armed conflict . Armed conflict occurs when escalation cannot be prevented \nor contained, leading to one party resorting to military force to compel their enemy to \nresolve the contradiction in their favour. Armed conflict is a special kind of \ncompetition because it is not  enduring; its role is to set the conditions for other forms \nof competition. Since armed conflict includes acts of nationally directed military \nviolence, it invariably has an exponential effect on human emotions, uncertainty and \nfriction. Mor eover, armed conflict is an extreme trial of physical and moral strengths, \nand tests both institutional and individual resources of endurance and resilience.  \nWar & Warfare  \n1.11.  War.  War is a state of armed conflict between different countries, or different groups \nwithin a country.  ( States seldom officially declare war in the modern era) . \n1.12.  Warfare .  Warfare is the conduct of war.  It is “the how” of waging war.  Warfare \ncontinues to change, evolve and be transformed by society, diplomacy, politics, and \ntechnology.  \n\nSERIAL 1 -01-02 \n1–01-02 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 \nKUWAIT NATIONAL SECURITY & DEFENCE POLICY  \nAND CRISIS RESPONSE & STRATEGIC PLANNING \n2.1.

Levels of Operations : The levels of operations provide a framework within which to \nrationalise and categorise military activity.  It consists of 3 overlapping levels as shown in \nFigure 3.1 .  This offers a general framework with which to plan and execute operations, and \na useful tool to organize and consider political/military activity.  This framework does not imply where decisions must be \nmade.  Events at one level ca nnot \nbe isolat ed from ano ther and the \nlevels generally overlap.  \n3.2. Strategic Level.  The Amir \nand Kuwait G overnment at t he \npolitical- strategic l evel, d etermines \nKuwait’s strategic end s tate and \nobjectives .  The st rategic  level \ndetermines t he military \ncontributions t o operations and \nstarts t he relationshi p with other \nstates and actors t o deliver \ncomplementary or su pporting \nactions t o achieve  collective  \nsecurity obj ectives .  Scarce or \npolitically se nsitive capabilities ar e \noften co mmanded at t his level. \n3.\n3. Operational Level. The \noperational level is defined by its role, which is to link and resource tactical -level activities to \nstrategic objectives. It is the essential gearing between the strategic and the tactical levels, \nwhere campaigns and major joint operations are planned, and actions are integrated and \nsequenced to achieve strategic objectives.   Capabilities that are required by multiple tactical \ncommands are often controlled at the operational level to enable them to be allocated when \nrequired.  \n3.4. Tactical Level .  The tactical level of operations is the level at which activities, battles \nand engagements are planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to \ntactical formations and units. The tactical level uses the echelons of command to further \nintegrate, prioriti se and coordinate their activity. This activity creates a range of effects that \ntogether contribute to successful operations . \n3.5. Relationship between the levels of operations.  The relationship between what is \ntactical  level, operational l evel and strategic level  is both fluid and contextual.  Tactical level \ngains and losses may have far greater strategic  level effects than that which is immediately \nobvious.  There is however a difference of focus between command at different levels.  In \npractice, even this apparently clear difference does not stop intervention by strategic level \npolitical and military leaders seeking to influence tactical level activity and giving lower -level \ncommanders very specific direction on what to do, as well as how to do it.  This might be when there is a clear political necessity to intervene at a certain time, in a certain place or in a certain way . \n3.6. Operational Art. Operational art is the mechanism the military uses to implement \nstrategies. Operational art combines the science of planning and the guidance from the tenets of doctrine with the skill, knowledge, experience, creativity and judgement of \nFigure 3.1 The \nLevels of \nOperations  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 commanders and staff to design and conduct strategies, campaigns and tactical operations \nto achieve policy goals and higher strategic objectives. \n3.7. Operational Domains (x5) :  (AJP- 01 & UK JDP  0-01 use slightly different wording)  \nA specified sphere of capabilities and activities that can be applied within an engagement \nspace.   (JDP 0 -01.1, UK Terminology Supplement to NATO  Term , 2023 Edition)   \nOperational domains represent five specific spheres of military activity within the \nengagement space and provide a framework for organizing the military instrument. The term \n‘operational’ does not reflect the operational level of operations, it reflects operations and \nactivity. These operational domains provide a structural framework to group and analyse \ncapabilities that are unprejudiced by considerations of nations, political, military services or civilian ownership. Though capabilities are distinctive, some capabilities may act as a \nplatform for other domain capabilities. The characteristics of the operational domains are as follows : \n• Maritime domain. The maritime domain comprises capabilities and activities\nprimarily related to operating below, on and above the surface of the oceans, seas, bays,\nestuaries, islands, coastal areas and at the high- water mark, overlapping with the l\nand\ndom\nain in the landward segment of the littorals .\n• Land domain. The land domain comprises capabilities and activities primarily\nrelated to operating on the Earth’s land mass, ending at the high -water mark and\nov\nerlapping with the maritime domain in the landward segment of the littorals.\n• Air domain . The air domain comprises capabilities and activities primarily related t o\noper\nating in the airspace that begins at the Earth’s surface (overlapping with the maritim e\nand l\nand domains) and extending to the altitude where atmospheric effects on airbor ne\nob\njects become negligible.\n• Space domain . The space domain comprises activities and capabilities primarily\nrelated to operating in space, where atmospheric effects on airborne objects becom e\nnegl\nigible but its capabilities are enabled by assets on Earth. Therefore, the spac e\ndom\nain includes the satellites in orbit and beyond, supporting ground infrastructure  and\nt\nhe information layer connecting ground and space.\n• Cyber & Electromagnetic domain . The cyber and electromagnetic domai n\nc\nomprises capabilities and activities primarily related to operating within t he\ni\nnterdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data. This\nincludes the Internet, telecommunications network s, computer systems, em bedded\npr\nocessors, controllers and the electromagnetic waves with frequencies that constitut e\nt\nhe electromagnetic spectrum.\n• Information.  Although information is not a domain, information activities ar e\noper\national domain actions whose primary focus is to create a cognitive effect.  The\ni\nntegration of information operations staff in planning processes ensure that the full range\nof domain and information activities required to achieve a successful outcome ar e\nhar\nnessed. Successful integration of actions, within and across domains, enables  the\nc\nommander to gain and maintain the initiative by enhancing pre- emption,  surprise,\nsimulta neity, tempo and exploitation. This generates greater freedom  of manoeuvre in the\nengagement space to create physical, virtual and  cognitive effects within their operations\narea.\n3.8. Effects  and their Physical, Virtual and C ognitive Dimensions.  An effect is a \nchange to the engagement  / battle  space as a consequence of action. Derived from \nobjectives, effects bridge the gap between the different planning concepts; objectives and \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 actions , by describing what changes in the engagement  / battlespace space are required. \nThere are three types of effects  dimensions : physical, virtual and cognitive  \n3.9. Effect Dimensions . Effect dimensions highlight the interdependencies of the \nengagement  / battle space, thereby gaining a better understanding of the consequences of \nactions. The elements that constitute dimensions are as follows. \n• The physical dimension.  This  relates to consequences on the audiences, t he\ns\nub-surface, surface, airspace and space areas where all physical activities take place,\nand where audiences live, including all physical objects and infrastructure that support\nthem.\n• The cognitive dimension.  This relates to the consequences on the audiences’\nperceptions, beliefs, interests, aims, decisions and behaviours. It encompasses all forms\nof interaction between them (such as economic and political).\n• The virtual dimension.  This  relates to the consequences of activity on t he\ns\ntorage, content and transmission of analogue and digital data and information, and all\nsupporting communication and information systems and processes.\n3.10.  Effect Dimensions in Op Art .  Considering effect dimensions supports a \ncommander to use the manoeuvrist approach to achieve objectives by cognitively, physically \nand virtually  out-manoeuvring hostile audiences. This is done by identifying indirect and \noriginal ways of affecting points of influence and/or converging mass effects to overwhelm \npoints of influence defences, whilst dislocating the actor's strengths.  \n3.11.  Effects Dimensions in a Comprehensive Approach.  Effect dimensions provide a \nframework for the political, military and civilian partners to coordinate and synchronize their forces’ activities in time and space to create mutually supporting desired effects, whilst respecting the autonomy of each actor.  \n3.12.  Campaigns & O perations:  \n• A campaign is defined as: “A set of military operations planned and conducted t\no\nac\nhieve a strategic objective.” (AAP- 06 (2014)).\n• An operation is defined as: “a sequence of coordinated actions with a defi ned\npur\npose” (AAP -06)\n3.13.  Environments & systems. There are multiple types of environments, both physical \nand non- physical, and commanders use many terms to describe them. Examples include \n(but are not restricted to): information, maritime, urban, political and human. \n• Environment s.  An environment describes the system surrounding an activity.\n• Systems.  A system is a functionally, physically or behaviourally related group of\nregularly interacting or interdependent elements. A group of systems is a network.\n• The Operating Environment is defined as :\n“a composite of the conditions, circumstances and influences that affect the employment\nof capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander.” ( AJP-5 (2019 )).\nWe can understand the operating environment as a global set of complex, dynamic and interrelated networks, comprising political, military, economic, social, infrastructure and \ninformation systems, each exerting pressure and influence on the others. Underst anding \nthe nature and interaction of these systems as part of mission analysis helps the \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 commander define their engagement space and affects how they will integrate actions \nwith in it.  \n• The Information Environment is defined as : “An environment comprised of the\ninformation itself, the individuals, organizations and systems that receive, process  and\nconvey the information, and the cognitive, virtual and physical space in which this\noccurs. ” (AAP- 06 (2020))\n• Engagement space/battlespace . The engagement space and battlespace are\nsynonyms. The engagement space is part of the operating environment  where actions\nand activities are planned and conducted. The commander’s engagement space is oftenbroader than their operations area due to increasing interconnectivity of the effect\ndimensions. Furthermore, the varying degrees of relevance that geography  has i\nn\nc\nyberspace and space, the electromagnetic spectrum and the information environment\nmeans that a geographically bounded engagement space is  not always suitable.\n3.14. NATO Campaign Themes (AJP -01).  To hel p the planning and conduct of \ncampaigns and link them to the continuum of competition1 it is desirable to define the \ncampaigns theme.   \n• The c\nampaign themes use the concept of limitations (such as objective, means,\narea, time, rules of engagement and other political constraints) and the concept ofintensity (the expected degree and frequency of violence of the subordinate operations)\nto pro vide the framework for campaigns\n.\n• The t\nheme gives an understanding of the general conditions of the operati ng\nenv\nironment and the main type of military operations and activities it will be necessary to\nconduct.  It helps commanders and planners balance the military operations and activitiesthat comprise any campaign , including organizing their forces and allocating resources.\n• Types of operations are not fixed to a campaign theme and the composition of\noperations within each theme is fluid and depends on the operating environment\n and\npol\nitical appetite.  For example, combat operations can be conducted in warfighting,\nsecurity and peace support campaigns. However, combat operations would be scarce i n\npeac\ne support but may be predominant in warfighting campaigns.  The four types of\nCampaign themes are:\n1 See SOHB Serial  1-01-01. \nFigure 3. 2 The common relationship between the campaign themes and the contin uum of competition  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03  \n1–01-03 – 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025  \n• Peacetime Military Engagement .  The peacetime military engagement theme \nencompasses those military activities that are intended to shape the peacetime \nenvironment to encourage local or regional stability  in the medium to long- term.  \nPersistent engagement creates relationships and develops mutual understanding, influence and interoperability through: building partners' capacity; defence diplomacy; \noutreach; multinational training exercises; and other cooperative security activities. \nHumanitarian relief activities are the results of complex emergencies involving natural or \nhuman- made disasters or other endemic conditions, such as disease, hunger or p rivation .  \nPeacetime Military Engagement is sometimes called Defence Engagement.  \n• Peace Support .  This theme takes place in the rivalry zone of the continuum of \ncompetition.  The theme seeks to preserve peace or intervene early within a potential \nconflict to maintain stability, prosperity and the rule of law. Activities guided by this theme \ncontribute to the comprehensive approach on a range of civilian tasks to redress the \ncontradictions of a conflict, including: maintaining public order and security; security \nsector reform; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; transitional justice; \ninfrastructure reconstruction; and national reconciliation. The theme implies both soft and \nhard power actions. Soft power and hard power’s attraction comes through \ndevelopmental actions aimed at enhancing a government's willingness and ability to c are \nfor its people. Hard power’s coercive actions apply a cost or a denial -of-benefits to those \nwho try and stretch the boundary of the peace settlement or the RBIO. This theme \npredominantly consists of peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities.  \n• Security .  The security campaign theme applies within the confrontation zone of the \ncontinuum of competition, with the five principles of deterrence being implicit in the \ntheme’s nature.   The security theme implies that the state  detects, deters and, if required, \nresponds to strategic competition’s operating techniques, especially threshold shifting. This may be contesting sub- threshold activity or conducting peace enforcement pre - or \npost-warfighting operations . These are  operating environment s where Armed Forces are \nused to re -establish stability and prosperity, underpinned by the rule of law.  Security is \nnot absolute, commanders are likely to support the activities of other actors in protecting, \nstrengthening and restoring civil society, governance, rule of law and the economy. \nExamples include counter -insurgency (COIN) operations, contribute to stabilization and \nreconstruction operations, or a mixture of both.  \n• Warfighting.  Warfighting occurs above the threshold of armed conflict  of the \ncontinuum of competition .  Warfighting takes place when the conflict has reached a point \nthat the only way to change behaviour, attitude or resolve a contradiction is primarily \nthrough armed force.  Activity will be usually a series of  high-intensity engagements \nthrough one or more domains with effects created in all dimensions against a significant form of armed aggression perpetrated between one or more states, or a well -organiz ed \nand resourced non -state actor.  It is likely the enemy will combine unconventional and \nsub-threshold methods with their combat operations as part of an overall strategy.  As a \nresult, the wider effects of armed conflict may be less bounded by traditional distinctions, \nsuch as the home base and theatre of operations. This theme will predominantly consist \nof combat and major crisis response operations.  \n3.15.  Spectrum of Conflict :  Figure 3.3 below depicts the spectrum of conflict in relation \nto the level of anticipated violence and scale of operation.  The NATO campaign themes are \nmaped on the spectrum.  On the far left, stable peace is characterized by the absence of \nconflict, on the far right, there is high -intensity conflict.  Within the spectrum, levels of \nviolence are not clearly distinguished but both blend into one another, transition quickly and can vary in space and time.  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 3.\n16. Types of Operations (AJP -03).  Operations are also categorized with reference to \nessential characteristics that differentiate them from one another.  Within the spectrum of \nconflict, all types of operations may be developed according to Kuwait’s needs.  The same \ntype of operation may take place at different points of the spectrum of conflict and be related \nto different campaign themes depending on the level of violence faced in the operating \nenvironment.  The two major types of operation (NATO compliant) are:  \n1. Combat .  Combat operations may be required to directly defend Kuwait against  an\naggr\nessor.  Combat operations tend to be characterized by a series of battles and major\nengagements, and therefore involve intense activity and high logistic consumption.\n2. Crisis  response .  Crisis response operations (CROs) include multifunctional\noperations, which contribute to conflict prevention and resolution, humanitarian purposes\nor crisis management in pursuit of declared National objectives.  CROs may be as\ndemanding and intense as  combat operations.   Crisis Response is sometimes referred to\nas Stability.  Crisis response is further divided into:\n• Military contribution to  Counter -irregular Activities . Counter -irregular\nactivities fall into three categories :\nCounter -insurgency .  COIN is defined as: “comprehensive civili an and\nm\nilitary efforts made to defeat an insurgency and to address any core\ngrievances ”.  The military instrument is only one element of the\ncomprehensive approach necessary for successful COIN, although thesecurity situation may require the joint force to execute tasks that other\norganizations are better suited to conduct.\nCounter -terrorism.  Counter -terrorism is all preventive, defensive\n and\nof\nfensive measures taken to reduce the vulnerability of forces, individuals  and\npr\noperty against terrorist threats and/or acts, to respond to terrorist acts.  I n\nK\nuwait this can include measures to recover after such acts.\nCounter -criminality . Counter -criminality is the action focused on preventi ng\nor\nganized criminal groups from escalating their activities to the point where\nthey become a threat to Kuwait.\n• Military contribution to Peace Support .  Operations contributing to peac e\ns\nupport efforts impartially make use of diplomatic, civil and military means, normally\nin pursuit of UN Charter purposes and principles, to restore or maintain peace.\nSuch operations include conflict prevention, peace enforcement, peacekeeping,\nFigure 3. 3 The \nSpectrum of Conflict  \nschematic of \nCampaign Themes  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 peacemaking and peacebuilding.   Details are in AJP- 3.24 The Military Contribution \nto Peace Support.  \n• Military contribution to Humanitarian Assistance.  Humanitari an\nas\nsistance consists of activities and tasks which relieve or reduce human suffering.\nHumanitarian assistance may occur in response to both natural and man -made\ndi\nsasters.\n• Military contribution to Stabili sation and Reconstruction.  Stabilisati on\nand r\neconstruction are normally a civilian -led process that commonly takes plac e\ndur\ning, or after, crisis in states that have lost the capacity to govern themselves\neffectively.\n• Military contribution to Non- combatant evacuation . Non -combatant\nevacuation operations (NEO) are national diplomatic initiatives, with military forces\nparticipating in a supporting role. NEOs are operations conducted to relocate (to a\nplace of safety) non- combatants threatened in a foreign country.\n• Extraction.  Extraction operations may be described as missions where a\nforce conducts or assists in the withdrawal of military missions and units from a\ncrisis region.\n• Military Contribution to Sanctions and Embargoes.  In broad terms,\nenforcing sanctions and embargoes is designed to force a nation to obey\ninternational law or to conform to a resolution or mandate.  Examples are exclusi on\nz\nones, no fly zones\n• Military Contribution to Freedom of Navigation and Overflight .  Thes e\noper\nations are conducted to demonstrate international rights to navigate sea or air\nroutes.  Freedom of navigation is a sovereign right accorded by international law.\n3.17.  · Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA) . MACA is assistance is by the Armed \nForces to other government departments , which contributes to homeland resilience, for \nurgent work of national importance, responding to emergencies or in maintaining supplies and essential services. In addition, the Armed Forces may provide support to civil law \nenforcement agencies, such as the police or Border Force, in the maintenance of law, order \nand public safety using specialist capabilities or equipment beyond that of civil powers. \n3.18.  Tactical Military  Activity :  Experience demonstrates that a wide range of military \nactivities are required simultaneously during any type of  operation, rather than a single focus \nor sequential progression.  The 4 types of types of tactical military activity are:  \n•Offensive.\n•Defensive.\n•Stability .\n•Enabling.\nAll operations are a balance of tactical activities, the amount of each tactical military activity \nvarying over time and between types of operation.  Conducting successful operations depends on understanding the type, quantity and simultaneity of these activities, how it \nevolves and changes through the campaign/operation; how it affects the planning and execution of operations and activities.  This is balance of tactical activities is illustrated in Fig \n3.4 below . \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 3.\n19. Boundaries & Areas:  T he area in which operations will be conducted is organi sed \nand labelled in such a way that all elements of a JTF have a common understanding of its \nprincipal boundaries.  B oundaries are mission- dependent.  Boundaries will be used to \nenhance flexibility delineated by areas, limited by defining parameters such as time.   It is \nrecognized that the operating environment may expand, become more dispersed and non-linear.   \n•Theatre of Operations  (TOO) . A designated area, which may include one or mor\ne\nJ\nOA. A theatre of operations may include land, air, space and sea outside a JOA.\n•Joint Operations Area  (JOA).  Joint operations area. A JOA is a temporary area\ndefined by the strategic military commander, in which a designated commander JTFplans and executes  a specific mission at the operational level. A JOA and its defining\nparameters, such as time, scope of the mission and geographical area,  are contingency -\nor mission -specific and are normally associated with a JTF. The designated commander\nwould plan and conduct military  operations within a JOA to accomplish a specific mission.\n•Area of Operations (AOO) . The AOO is an area within a JOA defined by the joint\nforce commander for conducting operations.\n•Area  of Interest. The area of interest (A OI) is, for a given level of command, the ar\nea\nof\n concern to a commander relative to the objectives of current or planned operations,\nand which includes the commander’s areas of influence, operations and/or responsibility,\nand areas adjacent thereto.\nFigure 3.4 Illustrating  the balance of tactical activity type related to the anticipated use of force and campaign theme  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 •Area  of responsibility.

Introduction .  The Military Forces of any nation rarely work alone in isolation.  They \nmust always consider the contribution each military element; agency, government \ndepartment and Multi -National (MN) partner might play during an operation and work out \nhow they will integrate each into the relevant area of their HQ.  The manner in which this is \ndone is not prescriptive.   \n4.2. Comprehensive Approach.   The Comprehensive Approach is ‘ Combining all \navailable political, military and civilian capabilities, in a concerted effort, to attain the desired \nend state.’ (NATO definition)  This whole of government approach  (in NATO the ‘ whole of \nalliance  approach’ ) can consist of  Combined, Joint, Interagency, Inter -Governmental & Multi -\nNational (CJIIM) actors working alongside each other.  A comprehensive approach aims to \nbuild closer links and liaisons with relevant organizations and actors, on a regular basis, \nwhile respecting the decision- making autonomy of each organization.  NATO sees its \ncontribution to the  comprehensive approach  as having:  \n• Shared Outcomes . To achieve shared outcomes all participants involved i n\nc\nrisis resolution should think about the outcomes required to deliver a favourabl e\ns\nituation.\n• D\nialogue and C ooperation.  Dialogue and cooperation requires all parties t o\nac\ntively try and work together, both ahead of and during a crisis.\n• D\nistinctive Cultures of Different Agencies .  The joint force needs t o\nac\nknowledge the distinctive cultures of different agencies it will be partnered with.\nPartners will exist with their own mandates, aims and objectives.\n• M\nutual Dependence .  Mutual dependence is the quality where organisations\nrely on other organisations capabilities to achieve sharded outcomes.\n• S\nhared Situational Awareness. Shared Situational Awareness will allow\npartners to better understand who is doing what, where.\n• I\nmprove the ability to work effectively internally through civil -military\ninteraction .  Key here is to optimise the effectiveness of partners, so they can deliver\ntheir functions as best they can.\n4.\n3. Combined.  Operations conducted with forces from two  or more allies are referred to \nas Combined Operations.   There will be a defined command relationship between the forces . \n\nSERIAL 1 -01-04 \n1–01–04 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 4.4. Joint .  At the strategic level, operations in which forces from at least two  Services \nparticipate are known as Joint Operations.  This may lead to the establishment of a J TFHQ  \nwith defined command authority . \n4.\n5. Inter -Agency.  This refers to the range of agencies, both national and international, \nthat may be involved in a Theatre of Operations.  These include Other Government \nDepartments (OGDs), national intelligence agencies, international police organisations, Host Nation (HN) or indigenous partners, NGOs, humanitarian groups, private military and \nsecurity companies, and other contractors.  \n4.\n6. International Organisation (IO) .  An intergovernmental, regional or global \norganization governed by international law and established by a group of states, with \ninternational juridical personality given by international agreement, however characterized, \ncreating enforceable rights and obligations for the purpose of fulfilling a given function and pursuing common aims.  Note: Exceptionally, the International Committee of the Red Cross, \nalthough a non -governmental organization formed under the Swiss Civil Code, is mandated \nby the international community of states and is founded on international law, specifically the Geneva Conventions, has an international legal personality or status on its own, and enjoys some immunities and privileges for the fulfilment of its humanitarian mandate.  \n4.\n7. Multinational .  Adjective used to describe activities, operations and organizations, in \nwhich elements of more than one nation participate.  \n4.8. Multi -Nationality .  A Multi -national force is composed of military elements as follows:  \n•Coalition.  A Coalition is an ad hoc arrangement\nbetween two or more nations operating together for a\ncommon, defined and usually limited purpose.\n•A\nlliance .  An Alliance is a broader, longer term agreement for collectiv e\nac\ntion with agreed mutual responsibilities.  Example – NATO.\n+ \n + \n = \n +\n\nSERIAL 1 -01-04 \n1–01–04 – 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •C2.  Command and control arrangements are likely to vary.  Dependent on\nmembership, a Coalition may have a self -evident or designated lead nation (such as the\nUS). An Alliance, such as NATO, whilst comprising equal partners, may adopt a lead or\nframework nation.  The framework nation may undertake additional responsibilities (byexample, the provision of the operational commander, the majority of the operational HQstaff, and operational CIS infrastructure).

Introduction.  The Cooperation Council for the \nArab States of the Gulf (ﻣﺠﻠﺲ اﻟﺘﻌﺎون ﻟﺪول  اﻟﺨﻠﯿﺞ ,) originally \n(and still colloquially) known as the Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil ( GCC, ﻣﺠﻠﺲ اﻟﺘﻌﺎون اﻟﺨﻠﯿﺠﻲ ,) is a regional \nintergovernmental political economic and military \nunion consisting of Arab St ates of the Arabian Gulf. Its \nmember states are Kuwait, S audi Arabia, B ahrain, t he \nUnited Arab Emirates, Q atar, and Oman.  The Charter Figure 5.1 The Flag of the GCC  \nof the Gulf Cooperation Council was signed on 25 May 1981, formally establishing the \ninstitution.  The GCC Secretariat General is in Riyadh, with an office in New York. \nFigure 5. 2 The flags of the member nations  \nSERIAL 1-01-05 \n1–01–05 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 •The Ministerial Council :  The Ministerial Council is composed of the Forei gn\nM\ninisters of all the Member States or other ministers deputizing for them. It convenes\nits ordinary sessions once every three months.   The Ministerial Council formulat es\npol\nicies and making recommendations for promotion of cooperation among the\nMember States and achieving coordination among the Member- States for\nimplementation of the on -going projects.  It submits its decisions in the form of\nrecommendations to the Supreme  Council for its approval.\n•The Secretariat General .  The functions of the Secretariat General are broadly t he\npr\neparation of special studies relating to cooperation, coordination, planni ng and\npr\nogramming for common action, preparation of periodical reports regarding the work\ndone by the GCC, following up the implementation of its own decisions,  preparati on\nof\n reports and studies on the demand of either the Supreme Council or the Ministerial\nCouncil,   making arrangements for holding of the meetings of various organs,\nfinalization of their agenda and drafting resolutions.\n5.4. GCC Security cooperation.  The Gulf Security Agreement, signed at Manama in \nDecember 2000 was primarily about the GCC making the transition from co- operating on \nmatters of defence to a position of collective self -defence.  Accordingly, member states \nagreed that external aggression against any member would be regarded as aggression against them all; that any threat facing one state would be regarded as a threat to all, and \nwould necessitate various measures, including the use of military force, being taken to aid \nthe victim of aggression.  The agreement also provided for the development of  a GCC \nDefence Council  and the Peninsula Shield Force , and for the enhancing of military \ncooperation by arranging joint military exercises, agreeing on defence policies, and augmenting the countries’ collective defence capacity by strengthening the local arms industry.   In addition, it was agreed that all collaborative activities would fall under the \ndirection and supervision of the GCC’s Supreme Council  through its Defence Council’s \nHigh Military Committee, whose meetings are coordinated by the Assistant  Secretary  \nGeneral for Military Affairs.  \n5.5. The Peninsular Shield Force.  At its third summit \nheld in November 1982, the GCC’s Supreme Council decided \nto constitute a combined force composed of 5,000 soldiers \ndrawn from the six member states  to foster cooperation and \npartnership.  At its 26th summit held in mid- December 2005, \nthe Supreme Council decided to expand the strength of the force and diversify its armaments.  It became a mechanised \nforce composed of foot soldiers, armoured carriers, artillery and combat support elements. Since its inception,  the force \nhas held periodic training sessions and joint military exercises with the armed forces of each of the member states. The first such exercise took place in the \nUnited Arab Emirates in 1983. From 1986 onwards, training has been centralised at King \nKhalid Military City in Hufer al- Batin in northeast Saudi Arabia.   Combined Joint exercises \nare held every 2 years in one of the Member States.  \nFigure 5. 3 The badge of the\nPeninsular Shield Force  \nSERIAL 1-01-06 \n1–01–06 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION (NATO)  \n6.1. Introduction .  The North Atlantic Treaty organisation (NATO) is a political  and \nmilitary  alliance  of member countries .  The foundations of NATO were officially laid down on \n4 April 1949 with the signing by the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty, more \npopularly known as the Washington Treaty .  Article 5 of NATO’s founding charter, the \nWashington Treaty, sets out the Alliance’s collective defence commitment.   It states that an \nattack on one shall be considered an attack on all.  Article 5 has been invoked only once in \nNATO’s history, on 12 September 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks on the United \nStates.    \n6.2. Members of N ATO :  At pr esent, NATO \nhas 32 members.  In 194 9, the 12 f ounding \nmembers o f the Alliance  were : Belgium, C anada, \nDenmark, F rance, I celand, Italy,  Luxe mbourg, \nthe Netherlands,  Norway, P ortugal, t he U nited \nKingdom and the United States.  The other \nmember countries are: Greece and Türkiye   \n(1952), Germany ( 1955), S pain (1982), t he \nCzech  Republic, H ungary and Pol and (1999), \nBulgaria, E stonia, La tvia, Li thuania, R omania, \nSlovakia, S lovenia (2004), and Albania and \nCroatia (2009) Montenegro (2017) North \nMacedonia (2020). Finland (2023). Sweden \n(2024) . \n6.3. NATO’s Purpose:  NATO’s \nessential pur pose  is to safeguard t he \nfreedom and se curity of i ts members \nthrough political and military m eans. \n•P\nOLITICAL - NATO  promotes\ndemocratic values and encourages\nconsultation and cooperati on on\ndef\nence and security issues to buil d\nt\nrust and, in the long run, prevent\nconflict.\n•MILITARY - NATO  is committed t o\nt\nhe peaceful resolution of disputes.\nIf diplomatic efforts fail, it has t he\nm\nilitary capacity needed t o\nunder\ntake crisis -management\noperations.

There is a difference of focus between command at different levels  as shown in \nfigure 7.1.  The operational level is  defined as:  “the level of operations at which campaigns \nand major operations are planned, conducted and sustained to accomplish strategic \nobjectives within theatres or areas of operations”.    \n7.\n2. The operational level \nprovides the vital bridge between \nstrategic objectives and the tactical employment of forces.  At the \noperational level and within a designated joint operations area (JOA), armed forces are deployed and employed in accordance with \na strategy to achieve military -strategic objectives. \n7.3. Normally t his requires su stained operations w ith often \nsimultaneous and se quential act ions b y committed forces.   It \nis at t he operational level that t actical su ccess  in \nengagements and oper ations ar e combi ned to cr eate desired \neffects to ach ieve strategic obj ectives and at tain the NATO \nend state.  Of p rime importance  is for t he oper ational l evel \nCommander to understand clearly how hi s activities link with \nother st rategic  lines of o peration with in a co mprehensive \napproach  and w ith coalition partners and a llies. \n7.4. Stages of a Joint oper ation .  A joint operation \nnormally co nsists  of a number of st ages so me of which occur \nat the military st rategic  level (for example force  generation). \nTypical st ages at t he ope rational l evel, w hich may ove rlap \ndepending on the situation and mission, a re shown in the \nfigure 7.2 to the right.   \n7.5. Componency:  In a j oint oper ation, the highest \ntactical levels are the components operating directly under \nthe commander joint task force.  Components provide the \ncommand and control for groupings of force elements \nnormally organiz ed by domain, service or func tion, but the \nforce will be organiz ed to reflec t eac h specific operational \nrequirement.   \nFigure 7.1 The Levels of Operations  \nFigure 7.2 Stages of a Joint Operation  \n1–01\n–07 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 SERIAL 1-0 1–07 \nFew modern operations are carried out, let alone won, by one component work ing alone. \nThe essential point is that a succes sful joint campaign requires a holistic  approac h to \nmaximise the overall operational effect of the joint force, making best use of the complete \nrange of military capabilities.  Joint Operations are not about separating component \noperations into stov epipes  organised under a single point of command.  Joint Operations \nmust synchronise and integrate the component capabilities at the JTFHQ level, a s shown in \nfigure 7.3 below.   \n7.\n6. Integration  of Components into the Joint Task Force.  Integration of components \nshould start prior to the operation. It demands thorough joint (and possibly \nmultinational/multi -agency) preparation and training to develop mutual trust and \nunderstanding, and instil unity of effort. Successful operations are invariably characterised \nby constant liaison and effective communications.  \n7.7. Force Preparation .   Maintaining large deployable forces at high readiness  is \ninefficient. Most nations  operate  the principle of graduated readiness, by which Armed  \nForces are held at varying levels of preparedness to ensure an effective response by an \nappropriate force when required. The warning time is the period between first  indication of a \npotential crisis and the point at which committed forces are to be ready  for operations in \ntheatre.  Its main elements are illustrated below in Figure 7.4: \nFigure 7.4 Illustrating how to calculate a unit warning time for planning purposes.  A unit will move through a \nseries of preparation and training to ensure it is ready to be employed on operations.

Also See Serial 1-02-03 \nLand Doctrine Fundamentals . \n8.1. Land Power .  Land power is defined as: “the ability of land forces to exert decisive \ncontrol and influence on actors and the course of events ”.  Land \noperations cover all the activities planned and conducted by \nthe land component co mmander ( LCC).  The nature of land \noperations reflects the diversities and complexities of the \nLand Domain.  The land is unique in that it is where people \nlive.  L and oper ations ha ve to deal w ith the co mplexity o f a \ndomain characterize d by t he pr esence  of peopl e and their \ninfrastructure.  The totality of this co mplexity is m ore obvious \non the Land and requires an approach  that e mphasizes \ndecentralized command, f reedom of ac tion, tempo and \ninitiative, t o contend with t he m ultitude of problems,  activities \nand rapidly ch anging situations.   \n8.2. The Land Component (LC) .  Land forces’  roles \nnormally en tail se izing and holding terrain, neut ralizing \nenemy forces  and r egaining lost  territory.  They ar e able to \nconduct  simultaneously va rious t ypes of oper ations,  utilizing \nfires and manoeuvre t o apply ove rwhelming combat pow er, \nachieve  decisive  results,  protect t he force, and facilitate \nfuture operations.  A w ide variety o f missions may be \nexecuted, r anging from s ecurity t asks i n support o f \nstabilization activities an d reconstruction efforts to combat.  \nLand forces require su bstantia l materiel, wh ich normally \nrequires s ealift, ai rlift and gr ound t ransportation.

The Organisation of Land Forces. Land forces are generally structured \nhierarchically into formations, units and subunits and categorised by function, type and \nspecialist capabilities.  They are organised operationally by combining arms to form a \ncohesive and versatile whole.   \n8.5. Land Unit Hierarchy.  A typical hierarchy flows down from Army Group to Army , \nCorps , Division , Brigade, Unit and Sub-Unit. Formations and units are designed to be \nmodular and scalable, so that elements can be easily added or taken away, and they can be \nexpanded or contracted. The greatest capacity for this lies in corps and divisions.  \n8.6. Functional groupings : Land forces are categorised functionally as either combat, \ncombat support or combat service support force elements  \n• Combat : force elements are those that engage the enemy directly. They manoeuvre \nand fight, typically employing direct fire weapons, to gain ground, find and defeat the \nenemy, or acquire information. They include armoured, reconnaissance, infantry, and \nattack and reconnaissance aviation units.   \n• Combat Support  force elements provide operational assistance;  including fire and \nmanoeuvre support to Combat force elements. They are: helicopters, artillery, \ncombat engineers, intelligence, communications, command support and information \nops specialists.   \n• Combat Service S upport  is the organisational support provided to the whole force, \nprimarily in the fields of administration, logistic , health service support , equipment \nsupport  & infrastructure . \n8.7. Force type .  Complementary to functional categorisation, land forces are also \nclassified by their force type or specialist capability , commonly described in NATO as:  \n•  Heavy - armoured vehicles that maximise firepower and protection, a compromise is \nmade with operational and tactical mobility.  \n• Medium  - equipped with armoured vehicles that are optimised for long range \nmanoeuvre but still have some valuable protection and firepower . \n• Light  - dismounted light forces have limited firepower and intrinsic protection. Yet \nthey can theoretically go anywhere that human beings can go –  into mountains, \nforests, marshes, buildings, caves or subterranean structures  \n• ISR Forces; Air Manoeuvre Forces; Amphibious ; Mountain  \n8.8.

Recce Role .  To provide accurate, timely and continuous information to the force by \nday and night, in all weathers and across all military activities. \n8.10.  Recce Tasks .  Operating in advance of a unit or force, recce unit tasks include:  \na. Find.   Finding by the use of:\n• Surveillance.\n• Scouting.\n• Reconnaissance.\n• Raiding. (This could be considered strike  – but recce forces are not\ngenerally optimised to conduct strike operations and are better suited to\nthe find function which can then allow other elements to conduct strike).\n• Key leader engagement.\nb. Security  (through Find  and Fix normally with other assets, artillery and gui ded\nw\neapons for example).  Protecting the main body, when grouped with direct and\nindirect fire assets, can be used to delay an enemy advance or protect a flank.  Tasks\ninclude:\n• Screening.\n• Guarding.\n• Covering Force.\nc. Exploit .   Exploit by pushing on through gaps in defences, pursui ng a\nw\nithdrawing opponent or engaging a high value target.\n8.11.  Types  of Recce.  The equipment of reconnaissance units tends to match the \nformation for whom they work.  In the UK there are some specialist assets eg chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, as well as tracked, wheeled and light reconnaissance \nunits which, for historical reasons, are part of the Armoured Corps.  Commanders may group recce assets, and these can be task organised to other units and formations as required:  \n• Aviation reconnaissance, provided by battlefield helicopters.\n• Armoured reconnaissance (tracked) for armoured infantry/tank brigades an\nd\nd\nivision.\n• Mechanised reconnaissance (wheeled) for mechanised brigades and\ndivisions.\n• Light reconnaissance for light infantry brigades and divisions can be draw n\nf\nrom infantry units and task organised as required, f example parachute or\ncommando recce forces.• Special forces, who can do some recce tasks but are tasked at the strategic\nlevel.\n8.12.  Recce Planning Considerations . \na. Early tasking .   Reconnaissance units might be tasked after Step 1 of\n an\nes\ntimate if critical information requirements are identified, the lack of which will hol d\nup pl\nanning.\nb. Stealth .  The British reconnaissance philosophy traditionally espouses “recc e\nby\n stealth” (although the new UK Strike Brigade concepts may change this).  They\nare currently not best equipped to conduct recce by fire and would need reinforci ng\ns\nhould they be asked to do so.\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 c. Sustainment .  Although they will take all they need with them for a limited time,\ncovert and/or long -range  re-supply may be required by tasking separate joint forc e\nel\nements.\nARMOURED (TANK)  UNITS  \n8.13.  Tank Roles.  The primary role of armour is destruction of the enemy by offensive \naction.  The components of this are:  \na. Shock action .   Shock action is the sudden, concentrated application of\nviolence on an enemy from an unexpected direction. It is the combined effect of\nsurprise, mobility and firepower concentrated in time and space. By attacking i n\ns\ntrength at a weak spot at an unexpected moment and from an unexpected direction,\nan armoured force can destroy large numbers of the enemy. Shock action c an\npar\nalyse the enemy, helping to seize the initiative. Shock action can be particularly\neffective if it can be achieved at night or at a place that the enemy thinks is secure.Like surprise, the effects of shock action may be transient and local. It shoul\nd be\nex\nploited vigorously.\nb. Aggressive mobile action to destroy enemy armour .   Arguably the primary\ncomponent, tanks are there to kill enemy tanks.  The tank’s mobility, survivability,durability and flexibility combined with the firepower to destroy enemy armouraccurately whilst on the move, gives it the leading role in the des truction of enemy\narmoured fighting vehicles and strong points during the advance and withdrawal.Above this level it should be noted that increasingly armour is being supplemented by\nattack helicopters. Tanks provide the mobile element of the anti -armour plan i\nn\ndef\nence and should be concentrated and used offensively in the support of the\npositional element.\nc. Close combat in conjunction with infantry.   The presence of main battl e\nt\nanks adds momentum, reduces casualties, significantly enhances direct precisi on\nf\nirepower as well as boosts friendly force morale. When considering the COE, armour\ncan be task organised in a more flexible manner and in smaller groupings (minimum\nof a pair of tanks) to meet the specific mission/environmental requirements.\nd. Surveillance, target acquisition & reconnaissance (STAR) . The sighti ng\ns\nystems on armoured vehicles provide a protected, constant and all- weather STAR\ncapability, including thermal imaging and elevated fields of view.\n8.14.  Tank Tasks.  The following are likely tasks for armour within each function of the \nLand Tactical Framework (Find, Fix Strike and Exploit):    \n• Find.   Stand -off overwatch or recce by combat/fire.\n• Fix.   Fix by the use of own weapons as well as by indirect fire support\n• Strike.   By one of the 3 roles listed above.\n• Exploit.   By the use of their mobility and shock action.\n8.15.  Tank Planning Factors.  \na. Characteristics.   The characteristics of a tank are:\n• Firepower/lethality\n• Mobility/manoeuvre\n• Protection/survivability\n• Durability\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Flexibility\nb. Tank Employment Guidance: When employ ing armoured units, commanders  \nmust ensure that they use tanks aggressiv ely to exploit their full potential, particularly  \nfirepower and mobility.  The s hattering effect of armour against an enemy is  \nmaximised when tanks are c oncentrated, and therefore armour generally should be  \nused in the greatest numbers possible (COE dependent), and employed on  \nconsecutive rather than concurrent tasks. Even in defens ive operations, the tank will  \nbe us ed offens ively to defeat an attacker. In offensiv e combined arms operations, it  \nwill normally be armour that takes the lead in the break-i n and exploitation of initial  \nsuccess handing over to infantry as necessary.  Due to these characteristics, tank \norganisations are the primary manoeuvre or strike arm.  Further planning factors  \ninclude:\nc. Real estate.   In an offensiv e role, tanks need sufficient manoeuvre space in  \norder to use their mobility to best effect, which enhances surprise and protection.  In a \ndefensive posture, dispersal assists survivability; the rule of thumb being 1 squadron / \ncompany = 1 km².\nd. Signature (size, weight, noise, dust and thermal).   The presence of tanks is  \nhard to conceal.  Effort, imagination, s pace, cover and skilful driving are required to  \nminimise the chanc es of detection by  the enemy . The size, noise levels and  \npresence, however, can be used to intimidate an adversary as a s how of strength or  \nas part of a dec eption plan.\ne. Close quarter fighting.   Armour is excellent at creating entry points, breaching \nobstac les, des troying s trong points, carrying combat supplies, protecting infantry , \nproviding a communications platform, and providing devastating direct fire. However, \nat close quarters, armour has blind spots and can be vulnerable to dismounted \nadvers aries. In close country (such as forests) or built-u p urban areas, armour is \nparticularly v ulnerable due to high angle threats and restrictions to mobility, which \nresult in channelling and restricted arcs.  To counter the constraints of fighting in \nurban or close country armour can be used to great effect if grouped as a minimum in \npairs and combined with infantry.\nf. Obstacles.   Natural and artificial obstacles can restrict armour’s mobility and if  \ndeliberately canalised, armour can become vulnerable and a tempting target to an  \nadvers ary’s  anti-t ank, air and aviation weaponry.  However, they may often be able to  \novercome obstacles with the use of an attached bulldozer blade, engineer bridges  \nand the protection of infantry.\ng. Ground holding capability.  Tank s can deny ground by  the application of fire,  \nbut they cannot, by themselves , hold ground agains t a determined dismounted  \nenemy . This requires the intimate support of infantry.\nh. Sustainment.   The logistic demands of fuel, oil, spares, and general  \nmaintenance for tanks are considerable. For example, the fuel used by  a British  \nChallenger 2 squadron (18 tanks) operating across country for 1 day is 12,600 litres,  \nrequiring 3 x  fuel tankers.  In addition, whilst equipment is capable of operating 24  \nhours per day, crews  are not. Sensible use of notice to move times is  essential to  \npermit adequate crew rest, time for maintenance and battle procedure. Additional \nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 logistic challenges are created when armour is grouped with a non- tank unit not used \nto providing specialist maintenance and  ammunition.  \nINFANTRY UNITS  \n8.16.  Infantry Role .   To close with and defeat the enemy through close combat. \n8.17.  Infantry Tasks.  \na. Find.   Infantry collects information on adversaries, the ground, human terrai n\nand t\nhe environment through patrolling, supplemented by surveillance devices the\nhuman element of this gives them a persistent/24 -hour, all weather capability as well\nas make them ideal to gain information by speaking with local people.\nb. Fix.   Infantry fixes the enemy by denying him freedom of manoeuvre, whether\nby seizing terrain, manoeuvre or through deception operations, supported by a\nbattalion’s direct and indirect weapon systems, particularly those within its fir e\ns\nupport groups.\nc. Strike .   All infantry units strike the enemy through close, usually dismounted,\ncombat.  The infantry battalion is organised to deliver small scale area suppressi on\nw\nith its organic mortar platoon and accurate fire from direct fire weapons such as\nJAVELIN, HMG,  GMG, GPMG, and sniper and sharpshooter rifles.\nd. Exploit .   Infantry is able to exploit fleeting opportunities, particularly in complex\nterrain where armoured vehicles are restricted.  Combined arms groupings are themost effective grouping to exploit a situation, and must be in the first part of anexploitation force to seize, hold and expand an opportunity.\n8.18.  Types  of Infantry .   \na. Armoured infantry .   Armoured infantry are equipped with armoured infantry\nfighting vehicles to provide high mobility, protection and firepower, they enabl\ne\ni\nnfantry units to get onto the enemy position and fight using the vehicle as part of the\nclose combat system.  Armou red infantry is often employed alongside or with armour.\nb. Mechanised infantry.   Mechanised infantry use armoured personnel carriers\n(tracked or wheeled) to get to an area of combat before dismounting to conduct t he\nt\nask.  They often provide a fixed defensive point around which an enemy c an be\nc\nhannelled or our own armoured forces can manoeuvre and strike.\nc. Light infantry .   Light infantry are equipped with only light scales and no\narmoured vehicles, they self -deploy by foot carrying all their equipment.  Their\nlightness allows them to operate in the most complex terrains such as mountains,jungles and urban areas and make s them well suited to rapid strategic deployment.\nSpecialist light role infantry (such as parachute or commando units) may us\ne\ns\neparate insertion techniques such as air assault (para and TALO), vertical assault\n(mountain or sea cliffs) or amphibious assault from the sea.\n8.19.  Infantry Planning factors.   Infantry are able to operate continuously across all \ntypes of terrain and in all climatic conditions.  They can operate independently (as they are \ntactically self- sufficient) or as part of a combined arms grouping.  They can also be delivered \nby land, sea or air.  The infantry is the primary ground holding arm.  \nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 a.

Attack Aviation Role.   Attack aviation units provide the core element of air \nmanoeuvre (primarily through their offensive action role).  \n8.21.  Attack Aviation Tasks.  \na. Offensive action.   Offensive action involves the delivery of firepower, usually\nas part of the combined arms battle. The Apache is the main  platform for deliveri ng\nhel\nicopter weapons, whether as a discreet combat manoeuvre element, or i n\nc\nombination with other ground- based assets, such as air assault infantry or armour.\nHowever, armed light battlefield helicopters can provide fire support.\nb. Control and direction of fire power .   Aircrews offer a unique capability i n\nhel\nping to de- conflict, control and direct firepower from multiple sources includi ng\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 artillery, mortars, Naval Gunfire Support and ground attack aircraft. Aircrew are \nfrequently trained to operate as air observation posts for artillery and as forward air controller (airborne) for the control of other rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft. ( Find  \nand Fix or Strike ) \nc. Command Support . Command support covers a range of tasks, centred \non\nt\nhe movement and situational awareness of commanders, and the provision of vital\ncommunication links in the absence of a fully established ground network. Typically\nthese fall to light utility helicopte rs since they require a low signature aircraft, capable\nof operating to and from confined temporary/ad- hoc landing sites. Command support\ntasks include provision of an airborne command post, passage of information, or\nallowing a commander to  get around the battlefield.\nd. RECCE/ ISTAR .   Battlefield helicopters and light fixed wing aircraft mak e\nex\ncellent airborne ISTAR platforms and must be effectively incorporated into the\ncollection plan. Aircrew deliver live and valuable information to ground commandersas the tactical situation develops. Battlefield helicopter capability is mainly focused atthe tactical level, where it integrates and is layered with other collection assets,\nparticularly covering terrain that cannot be observed by ground- based assets.\nHowever , battlefiel d helicopter capabilities degrade with environmental and climatic\nconditions. Tasks include:\n• Aviation screen tasks to observe, identify and report information to\nground or aviation forces. It provides a manoeuvre commander with the means\nto cover flanks, dead ground and other areas of specific interest and,\ndepending on the aircraft equipment available, can be provided by both day\nand night in both an overt and covert manner.\n• Secondary observation tasks, where aircraft can often supply useful\ninformation when they are engaged on other tasks. For example, aircraft\nengaged on a screen or guard task can continue to observe and collect\ninformation whilst moving to and from their pr imary mission.\ne. Tactical mobility.   Tactical mobility involves the movement of force elements\nand materiel, provided mainly by medium and heavy -lift battlefield helicopters.\nBattlefield helicopter tactical mobility tasks are at the heart of air manoeuvre, air\nassault and amphibious operations, and include troop movement, deploymentartillery, air defence and combat engineer support, CASEVAC and logistic re- supply.\n8.22.  Attack Aviation Planning Factors .   Principal planning factors include:  \na. Environmental factors (loiter capability) .   The lift capacity and endurance of\nhelicopters could vary significantly according to the season and location.Environmental constraints, which restrict pilots’ visibility and helicopter activity, areweather, poor illumination or dust obscuration of landing sites.  In addition, high heat\nand altitude can reduce the load and range of an aircraft.\nb. Aircraft endurance.   Balancing fuel requirements with weapons, passengers,\nor freight affects aircraft endurance. In general, the greater the payload the less fuel\nwill be available, and the range or time available on task is consequently reduced.Additionally, more time will have to be taken transiting to and from fuel sites thoughlimitations are often reduced by the use of forward arming and re- fuelling points.\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 c. Vulnerability.   Helicopters are vulnerable to ground fire as well as air defenc e\ns\nystems.  To reduce vulnerability, helicopters must maximise the agility and mobility\nof the aircraft.  In air assault operations, commanders must consider the vulnerability\nof a land site’s location against pay off. For example, a landing site which is off -set\nfrom the target may pose less risk to the aircraft than the assaulting troops who must\ncover more ground to reach the objective. However, a landing site closer or on th e\nobj\nective may increase the risk to the aircraft (and the troops within them) but the\nchances of mission success may be greater.\nd. Sustainability.    Helicopters require a high level of maintenance, whic h\ni\nncreases with usage, and is costly in terms of resources.\nSERIAL 1–01–09 \n1–01–09 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 THE AIR (& SPACE)  COMPONENT  \nReference: JDP 0 -30 (3rd Edition Dated Sept 2022) . Also See Serial 4 -01-05 Air Doctrine \nFundamentals . \n9.1. Air Power .  Air power is defined as: the ability to use air capabilities  in and from the \nair, to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events .  Air power is truly global in \nnature as it theoretically enables access to any point on Earth, be it over land or sea using \nits enduring attributes of height , speed and reach .  Air power offers policy makers an agile, \ntimely and focussed capability that can be highly effective in resolving or averting a \ndeveloping crisis.  The use of air power can also potentially negate the requirement to \ndeploy a larger force over a broader timescale by land or sea.   \n9.2. Space Power .  Space power is defined as: exerting influence in, from, or through, \nspace. Like air power, the attributes of space power are related to the ability to exploit the \nvertical dimension.  The vast majority of military operations could not be sustained without  \nspace capabilities.  Operations  are dependent on space, principally for communications, \nmeteorological, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) functions, as well as for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR).  \n9.3. The Air Component .  The Air Component Headquarters (AC HQ) normally has an \nembedded Joint Air Operations Centre (JAOC), which may be static, or deployable \ndepending on the nature and scale of joint air operations.  In a coalition setting this is becomes a Combined Air operations Centre (CAOC). The AC HQ and JAOC may be sea or \nland- based and even transition between locations should the situation dictate; for example, \nduring the build- up and draw down phases of a joint campaign, or when his command & \ncontrol ( C2) or command & control system ( C2S) capability is threatened. The \nresponsibilities of the Air Component Commander (ACC) are assigned by the Joint Task \nForce Commander and usually include:  \n•Developing a Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP).\n•Recommending apportionment of joint air assets to the JTFC.\n•Allocating and tasking joint air assets based on the JTFC’s air apportionmentdecision.\n•Overseeing, guiding, integrating and adjusting the execution of Joint Air operations incoordination with the JTFC and affected Component Commanders.\n•Evaluating the results of Joint Air operations and forwarding assessments to the\nJTFC to support the overall assessment effort.\n•Providing and receiving appropriate liaison officers (LOs).\n•Performing the duties of the airspace control authority (ACA).\n•Performing the duties of the air defence commander (ADC).\n•Functioning as a supported or supporting commander.\n•The ACC may also be nominated as the Space Coordinating Authority (SCA).\n9.4. Airspace Control Authority (ACA) .  The ACA has the overall responsibility for \nestablishing and operating an appropriate airspace control system through an Airspace \nControl Plan (ACP). The ACP is developed in consultation with the JFC, the other \ncomponents, and the HN where appropriate, in order to integrate, coordinate or deconflict all \nairspace user requirements.  \nSERIAL 1–01–09 \n1–01–09 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 9.5. Air Defence Commander (ADC) .  The ADC is responsible for integrating the Air \nDefence (AD) assets of joint components into a coherent Joint Air Defence Plan (ADP). This \nincludes establishing weapons control procedures and measures for all Defensive Counter -\nAir (DCA) weapon systems and forces, coordinating with regional and/or HN Ground Based \nAir Defence (GBAD)  systems, and exchanging information necessary to support civil \ndefence activities.   An example of layered air defence is illustrated below in figure 9 .1; \nshowing a mixture of air and ground based assets.  In addition to the weapon systems, there \nwould also be air and ground based radars and C2 elements:  \n9.\n6. Space Coordinating Authority (SCA) .  SCA is normally held by the J TFC, but may \nbe delegated to a subordinate commander, as appropriate. The SCA is responsible for \nfacilitating unity of effort across  national and military space capabilities in support of joint \noperations.  He does  this by gathering operational requirements across the joint force and \ndeveloping a prioritised list of space requirements based on JFC objectives.   The SCA’s task \nis challenging because space assets (by their nature) are  considered  strategic assets (few in \nnumber and many capable of servicing multiple theatres/operations in each pass). C2 and \nexecution authority is  usually centralised with the asset owner/operator, and it would be \nunusual for  responsibilities to be delegated; therefore, the SCA must coordinate for their use \nthrough agreed C2 relationships.  \nFigure 9.1: An example of layered air defence  \nSERIAL 1-01-10 \nTHE MARITIME COMPONENT  \nReference: JD P 0-1- UK Maritime Power ( 5th Edition dated O ct 2017) . \nAlso See Serial 1-02-02 Maritime Doctrine Fundamentals. \n10.1. Maritime Power.  Maritime power is defined as: “the ability to apply maritime \nmilitary  capabilities a t and from t he se a to influence the behaviour of act ors and t he course  \nof eve nts”.  Maritime power i s not only appl ied in the m aritime domain but al so across  the \nother domains a s well.  In the physi cal se nse the maritime domain comprises  the hi gh seas,  \nexclusive economic zo nes and territorial se as.  Maritime forces are those  oper ating at or \nfrom t he sea.  \n10.2. The M aritime Component ( MC).  The M C provides a broad, agi le and scalable \ncapability,  which can ope rate w ithin all environments from the open ocean t o the littoral, and \nacross  beni gn to co mbat co nditions.   It ca n also enable the delivery or i ntegration of Land \nComponent and Special Forces C omponent asse ts and st aging of ai r ope rations.   Maritime \noperations i nclude any a ctions pe rformed by surface, s ubsurface and/or maritime air f orces \nto gain or exp loit se a control o r sea deni al and/ or to project  pow er from the sea.  Sea control \nmay al so include naval c ooperation and gui dance  of sh ipping, p rotection of the sea l ines of \ncommunication, bl ockades or em bargoes agai nst economic or m ilitary sh ipping and maritime \ninterdiction operations.  This i ncludes  oper ations to locate, cl assify and track  surface  \nvessels,  submarines and ai rcraft and, i f required, applying force  agai nst them.  Amphibious  \noperations  with their i nherent f lexibility i ncrease  the commander’s opt ions f or manoeuvre. \n10.3. Command and C ontrol (C2) .  The M aritime C omponent C ommander (MCC) has  a \nplanning function withi n the J oint Ta sk Force HQ t hat p rovides maritime input t o the \ncampaign plan, but his p rimary f unction is t o exercise maritime command at t he tactical \nlevel.

The l ocation ultimately \nselected for t he M CC a nd his s taff w ill be driven by operational i mperatives.   When af loat, a \nsuitably co nfigured ship can meet all t he MCC’s  planning and execution n eeds,  particularly \nrobust  communications,  but al so, provide high levels of force protection.   \n10.4.

The C 2 of a mphibious operations i s det ailed in \neither t he Joint Commander’s M ission Dir ective  or the JTFC’s C ampai gn Planni ng Directive  \n(WNGO 3) o r OPLAN .  These directives sp ecify the command r elationships bet ween t he \nCommander A mphibious Task Fo rce, the Commander Landi ng Force  and other component \ncommanders i nvolved.  It al so states t he co mmand relationships w hich will apply on \ntermination of the amphibious oper ation.

Structure .  The  principal formation for maritime forces is the Maritime Task Force.  \nEach Task Force is assigned a commander  who may either report directly to the Maritime \nComponent Commander (MCC)  or may be dually appointed as the MCC in which case he \nwill report directly to the Commander of the Joint Task Force (CJTF) .  The Commander (of \nthe) Task Force (CTF) may further subdivide the Task Force into Task Groups  and Task \nUnits to exercise command and control at the tactical level.  Each of these sub- formations \nwill be assigned a commander: a CTG will command a Task Group and a CTU will \ncommand a Task Unit.  These sub- formations  may be organise d based on capabilities, \ntasks , geography, or a combination of all three.   Each sub- formation will comprise a number \nof Task Elements (individual ships or submarines).  The 4 levels of maritime command are:  \n• Task Force (TF)  – the ships and submarines that collectively comprise a \ndiscrete, usually multi -capability, maritime force with forces assigned to \nfulfil specific missions  and tasks  as part of the force generation process .  \n• Task  Group (TG)  – the ships and / or submarines that comprise a task or \ncapability -oriented formation within a Task Force.  \n• Task Unit (TU)  – the ships and / or submarines allocated a specific task or \nrole from within a Task Group.  \n• Task Element (TE)  – individual ships or submarines allocated to a Task \nForce.  \n \n \n10.6.  The Maritime Task Force.  Figure 10.2 shows a representative Maritime Task \nForce (TF 333).  TF 333 comprises 4 Task Groups:  an Amphibious Group to project power \nashore and a Carrier Group  to deliver Carrier Strike in  both the counter -sea and counter -land \nroles, and to provide air defence to the task force .  The role of the Advance Force  is to \nprepare the landing ground for the Amphibious Group and to clear choke points of mines.  \nSubmarines deliver maritime fires , contribute significantly to intelligence, situational \nawareness and reconnaissance (ISR) and are the task force ’s most capable anti-submarine \nand anti -surface ship warfare platforms in w hich capacity they contribute significantly to Sea \nControl .  This is not the only way in which a task force can be put together and it assumes \nthat CJTF has delegated Operational Control (OPCON) of the individual platforms to the \nMCC.  \n10.7.  Escorts and Logistic Shipping .  Within TF 333, t he escorts are included as a \nsingle Task Unit within the Carrier Group to  provide both Above Water and Anti -submarine \ndefence to the entire task force  as well as contributing to Maritime Fires .  In a Task \nOrganisation such as the one illustrated here, escorts would most likely b e ‘detached’  from \nthe Escorts TU to provide cover for the Advance Force and to the Amphibious Group, in \nwhich case they would be attached to the receiving formation.  Similarly, logistic shipping \nwould be ‘detached’ from the Logistic Shipping TU and ‘attached’ to support these \nformations.  \nFigure 10. 1 Symbols for \nMaritime Groupings  \nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Figure 10.2 – Maritime Task Force Diagram (Task Force 333)  \n10.8.  Maritime Air .  Ideally both air defence and maritime patrol aircraft will be available \nfrom land- based air, but this cannot be relied upon in all situations (eg, the Falklands Conflict \nof 1982 where the task force in the JOA was outside the range of all friendly land- based \nfighter aircraft).  In situations when land- based air support is not available, aircraft embarked \nin the a ircraft carriers would  be employed to provide air defence , flying Combat Air Patrol s \n(CAPs) over the task force.   Aircraft carriers also operate Airborne Early Warning (AEW) \naircraft for ISR and providing C2 to strike missions.  \n10.9.  Carrier  Group.  A Carrier Group (in the United States Navy known as a Carrier \nBattle Group)  will comprise:  \n•Aircraft Carriers  – CATOBAR / VSTOL Carriers1.\n•Submarines  – A nuclear -powered attack submarine (SSN) will invariably be\nat\ntached to the Carrier Group in either the Direct Support or Associated Support\nroles.  (See Para 10.20 ).\n•Escorts:\n–Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) escorts (Frigates / Corvettes) .\n–Anti Air Warfare (AAW) escorts (Destroyers or AEGIS Cruisers) .\n–Anti Surface Warfare (ASuW) ships (All Surface -to-Surface Missile (SSM) or\nmedium calibre gun (115 mm / 127 mm) equipped escorts) .\n1 Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Assisted Recovery (CATOBAR); Vertical / Short Take Off and \nLanding (VSTOL) – refer to Chapter 2: Naval Ships and Submarines.  \n\nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Logistic Shipping :\n–Fuel Tankers .\n–Stores Ships .\n–Miscellaneous logistic shipping such a Forward Repair Ship or Primary Casualty\nReceiving Facility ( Ship).\n–Ships Taken Up from Trade (STUFT) including bulk tankers and containervessels.\nA Flag Officer would be embarked in the most capable aircraft carrier as the Commander of \nthe Carrier Group (CTG 333.3).  He may also fulfil the role of Commander of the Task Force (CTF 333).  \n10.10.  Amphibious  Group.  An Amphibious Group will comprise:  \n•Amphibious Shipping:\n–Specialist Amphibious Transports – Landing Platforms Dock and Helicopter\n(LPD / LPH), and other Dock Landing Ships and specialist amphibious shipping.\n–Ships Taken Up From Trade – Roll On Roll Off (RoRo) ferries, passenger liners,\ncontainer ships etc .\n•The Landing Force  – soldiers, marines and their vehicles and other equipment\nembarked in both STUFT and specialist amphibious shipping.\n•Tailored Air Group  – Attack Helicopters (AH) and Support Helicopters (SH).\n•Escorts – ASW, AAW and ASuW ships may be detached to escort the A TG if th\ne\nTas\nk Force is not sailing as a single force.\n•Logistic Shipping  – specialised logistic shipping and STUFT may form part of the\nATG or may need to be detached to support the ATG.\nAs with the Carrier Task Group, a Flag Officer is likely to be embarked as the Commander of the Amphibious Task Group (COM ATG / CTG 333.1).  A General Officer will normally be appointed as Commander of the Landing Force (CLF). \n10.11.  Advance Force.  The Advance Force comprises the specialist shipping required to \nprepare the beaches and their approaches for an amphibious landing.  The Advance Force \nwill comprise: \n•Mine Counter Measures Vessels (MCMVs)  – Mine Hunters (MH) and Mi\nne\nS\nweepers (MS) .\n•Survey Ship  – for Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) of the littoral areas .\n•Support Ship – to support the MCMVs up threat with logistic and maintenanc e\nf\nacilities (could be the Survey Ship utilised for the REA or another platform) .\n•Escorts – escorts may need to be detached to protect the Advance Force  which  will\nus\nually have a slower SOA (Speed of Advance or passage speed) than the main task\nfor\nce.\nThe Commanding Officer (CO) of the survey ship will normally act as the Commander of the \nAdvance Force Task Group (CTG 333.2) and as the MCM Commander.  \nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 10.12.  Submarines .  A UK or US led Task Force will usually include Nuclear Attack \nSubmarines.  Other Task Forces could include conventional submarines (SSKs) but these \nwill be limited in their endurance and SOA . \nFORMATION AND SUB -FORMATION NUMBERING \n10.13.  Task Force.  Because, by definition, a maritime Task Force is an organisation \ncreated for a particular operation, it will be assigned a unique number for that  operation. \nUnited Kingdom, United States and NATO -led coalitions tend to use a 3-figure number such \nas ‘3 -3-3’ as in Task Force 333 illustrated here.  \n10.14.  Task Group.  Within a particular Task Force, its Task Groups will be sequentially  \nnumbered taking the number of the parent formation and separating the sub- formations  by a \ndecimal point.   The Task Groups in Task Force 333 will therefore be  numbered 333.1 \nonwards.  \n10.15.  Task Units .  Task Units will take the number of the parent Task Group, say  Task \nGroup 333.1, and follow a similar process. Within Task Group 333.1, the Task Units will be \nnumbered 333.1.1, 333.1.2 etc.  \n10.16.  Task Elements.  Each Task Element will have its own unique number assigned \nfollowing a similar process so that the ships within Task Unit 333.1.1 will be sequentially \nnumbered 333.1.1.1, 333.1.1.2 and so on. Once a ship or  submarine has been assigned a \nnumber as a Task Element with a Task Force,  this number will not change regardless of \nsubsequent tasking.  \n10.17.  Levels of Command.  Not every ship will be assigned to a Task Unit or even to a \nTask  Group.  In the Task Force 333 example, the submarines are part of Task Group 333.4 \nbut are not assigned to a Task Unit.  \n10.18.  Maritime Air .  For the purposes of the exercises at the MAJCSC, the strike and air \ndefence aircraft embarked in the carriers will be assigned to the joint air planning process.  \nWhat this means in simple terms is that they will be tasked by the Air Component \nCommander and not the MCC.  Organic helicopters in the escorts remain under the tasking \nauthority of the MCC through his subordinate commanders.  In reality, only a proportion of the carrier -borne aircraft would be assigned to the joint air planning process; the remainder \nremaining under the OPCON of the MCC.  \nATTACHMENTS AND DETACHMENTS  \n10.19.  When Task Org -ing in the land domain , sub -units may be detached from one unit or \nformation and attached to another to deliver an all -arms capability.  The sub- units that move \nare known as attachments and detachments or ‘atts and dets’ and the process is called battlegrouping.  A similar proc ess may be used in the maritime domain when ships with \nspecific capabilities may be detached from one formation and attached to another.  For \nexample:  \n• Amphibious Task Group.  If CTF 333 had a task to conduct an amphibious\noperation, escorts and logistic shipping would be detached from their original\nformations (TU 333.3.2 and TU 333.3.3) and attached to the ATG (TG 333.1).\nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Advance Force.   Whenever an amphibious operation is planned, the Advance Force\n(TG 333.2) may need to operate independently in order to prepare the landi ng\ngr\nounds.  Cover will need to be provided by suitable detached escorts and logistic\nshipping in a similar manner as  for the ATG.\n• SLOCs Group.  If the CTF has a task to protect the Sea Lines of Communicati on\n(\nSLOCs), he might assign the task to the Carrier Group (TG 333.3) with the CTG\nundertaking the role of SLOCs Group Commander.  The carrier would nee d a\nnum\nber of the escorts to provide defence against the air, surface and sub- surface\nthreats as well as logistic shipping to support the group when detached from the mai n\nbody\n of the Task Force.\n10.20.  Nuclear Submarines .  The SSN attached to the Carrier Group will be in either the \nDirect Support (DS) or Associated Support (AS) role.  Direct Support means that the CTG of \nthe Carrier Group has TACOM of the submarine.  Associated Support is when TACOM is \nheld at a higher (Joint or national) level when the CTG will only be delegated TACON . \n10.21.  Ad Hoc  Formations.  On occasions it may be necessary to create new formations \nto conduct specific tasks.  For example, a Surface Action Group (SAG) is formed of \nspecialist escorts with the necessary logistic support to engage enemy surface or submarine forces in open waters.  A SAG would be formed as an independent Task Unit under the \ntactical command of the senior Commanding Officer of the warships forming the SAG.  The \nSAG would then be detached from the maritime task force main body to take the fight to the \nenemy.  The ‘surface’ in SAG refers to the situation in which the SAG operates and not the \nwarfare discipline of ASuW.

The Logistic Component ( LogC ).  A LogC  provides the focal point for logistic \nsupport and optimum means of controlling logistic assets spread across components.  While \ncomponent logistics are focused forward  to deployed units , the LogC  not only looks forward \nto provide logistic support to them , but also looks back to monitor the logistic activities of the \nstrategic base.  A LogC  is likely to be deployed when the scale or complexity of the \noperation exceeds the capacity of JTFHQ J1/J4 staff.  The LogC  undertakes the more \npractical aspects of operational and tactical logistics, allowing JTFHQ J1/J4 staff to \nconcentrate on critical campaign logistic factors.  \n11.2.  Role .  The LogC  delivers coherent support to the JTF by taking responsibility for \nactivities of benefit to 2 or more components, coordination between components and the \nappropriate use of their logistic resources.  The LogC  will be responsible for the RSOM \nelement of Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI).  It will assist in \nthe integration process , but this is a J3- led activity.  The LogC  will sustain the RSOI \noperation.   It controls the theatre end of the coupling bridge and ensures that stocks arrive in \ntheatre and are distributed in accordance with the JTFC’s priorities.  A LogC  is not \nresponsible for the detailed management of component logistics but does exercise a \ncoordinating function to ensure that the JTFC’s priorities are met.  A LogC  may be allocated \na specified Area of Operations, for which it has force protection and other responsibilities.   If \nthis is not the case, close liaison with the headquarters performing this function is necessary. \nThe specific LogC  responsibilities are to:  \n•Command all logistic assets assigned to the LogC  in the JOA.  It contributes to the\nJTFHQ estimate process and liaises with coalition partners, deployed contractors\nand the host nation.\n•Coordinate in- theatre logistic support, in accordance with the JTFC’s priorities,\nthrough activation and maintenance of robust lines of communication.  Components\nretain command of their integral logistic assets, unless otherwise directed by theJTFC. However, to maximise efficiency, the LogC  is normally given coordinati\nng\naut\nhority.\n•Establish and manage the Recognised Theatre Logistic Picture, as part of the Joint\nOperating Picture.\n11.3.  LogC  Functions .  The Joint Force Logistic Component  is critical to preparing, \nprojecting, sustaining and recovering the JTF and carries out a range of specific functions in \nsupport of a deployed force:  \n•Theatre Activation.\n•Movement Control.  This includes mov ement into the JOA in accordance with the  \nJoint Desired Order of Arrival Staff Table (JDOAST).\n•Establishing In-T heatre Movement and Life Support. The LogC is res ponsible for  \ncoordinating intra-t heatre movement, including related life support. This normally  \nrequires joint control to optimise transport assets.\n•Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI). Reception,  \nStaging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI) is a c omplex joint C2 operation.  \nIt draws together the movements and administrative functions neces sary to move,  \nproces s, accommodate and provide life support to a transiting force. The RSOI  \nelement is normally c ontrolled by the LogC HQ, in liaison with the JTFHQ.  Control of \nSERIAL 1-01-11 \n1–01-11 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 integration activity is likely to be primarily a component responsibility in conjunction \nwith the JTFHQ J3.  \n•Intra -Theatre Supply. The LogC  controls intra- theatre air transport and usually mai n\ns\nupply routes.\n•Logistic Support .  The LogC  exercises  coordination authority over all in- theatre\nlogistic assets, as well as command of those units which provide joint support.  Force\nlevel logistic support encompasses supply and distribution, movements,maintenance, infrastructure, provision of fuel, water, electrical power, temporarydeployable accommodation as well as medical and personnel administrative support.This support may be provided from own armed forces  or multinational sources, from\nthe host nation, from contractors or from other in country resources.\n•Force Supply and Distribution.  Supply and distribution units under command ofthe LogC  are responsible for the receipt, storage, control, maintenance, accounti\nng\nand di\nstribution of operational logistic stocks for environmental components, i n\nac\ncordance with the Joint Task Force Commander ’s priorities.\n11.4.  Logistic Command & Control .    Deploying a scalable, task -organised LogC  HQ \nenables logistic support between components to be coordinated. The headquarters has a \ndual role:  \n•Looking forward, to provide logistic support to the components in theatre;\n•Looking backward, to monitor and influence logistic activities from, and in the\nstrategic base . \nStrat HQ Log Staff:  \n•Determine the logistic feasibility of\noperations\n•Inform the Joint Task Force Commander(JTFC) where logistic vulnerabilities li\ne\nand w\nhere risks can be taken\n•Exploit logistic strengths and minimis e\nw\neaknesses arising from deployed forc e\nel\nements or assets, taking remedial\naction as necessary\nD evelop future plans, includin g\npr\noviding the logistic input t o\nr\nedeployment planningJTFHQ Log Staff:  \n•Sets the theatre logistic\npolicy\n•Establishes the logisticand movement priorities\nwithin the joint operationsarea;\nMon itors the recognised\ntheatre logistic pictureMilitary \nStrategic HQ  \nFigure 11. 1 Illustrating logistic command and control on an operation  \nSERIAL 1-01-12 \n1–01-12 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 THE SPECIAL FORCES COMPONENT  \n12.1.  The Special Forces Component .  The Special Forces Component Command \n(SFCC) is also known as the Special O perations  Component Command (SOCC)  in NATO .  \nSpecial operations are military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, \ntrained, and equipped forces using operational tactics, techniques, and modes of employment not standard to conventional forces.  These activities are conducted across the \nspectrum of conflict independently, integrated with, or in coordination with operations of conventional forces to achieve political, military, informational, and economic objectives.  Politico -military considerations may require low prominence, covert or discreet techniques, \nand the acceptance of a degree of physical and political risk not associated with \nconventional operations.  Special operations differ from conventional operations in degree of \nphysical and political risk, operational techniques, mode of employment, independence from \nfriendly support, and normally depend on detailed operational intelligence and indigenous \nassets.  \n12.2.  Role .  Special Forces have 3 main functions, which can be used in isolation or to \ncomplement one another:  \n•Surveillance and Reconnaissance. SF conduct covert ISTAR by land or sea in astatic or mobile role and can provide timely information to commanders at all levels.\n•Offensive Action. Offensive action is designed to achieve a focused effect with a\nminimum of unintended consequences.  Actions are directed against high val\nue\ns\ntrategic or operational targets, which may require covert  infiltration or specialist\ntechniques.  Offensive action may be conducted in patrol to multiple squadr on\ns\ntrength, independently or supported by  conventional forces.\n•Support and Influence .  Support and influence activities are often  conducted i n\ns\nupport of other government departments, usually as part of wider political or military\nobjectives.\n12.3.  Special Forces Component Commander’s Responsibilities .  Specific SFCC \nresponsibilities include:  \n•Acting as a JTFC in his own right drawing together elements from other components\nfor a SF- led operation.\n•Contributing to the JTFC’s estimate and developing, maintaining and implementi ng\nS\nF operations that best support the JTFC’s intent.\n•Acting as a supported or supporting component commander.\n•Providing functional advice to the JTFC on the correct employment of SF and\nc\nontributing to planning as appropriate.\n•Coordinating with the other component commanders to ensure unity of effort.\n•Exercising C2 of SF and other assets assigned by the JTFC.\n12.4.  Special Forces Component Headquarters (SFCHQ) Command & Control .  The \nSFCHQ is  normally deployed alongside a JTFHQ.  In multinational operations, it would form  \npart of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force, normally with a liaison party at \nthe JTFHQ.  The SFCHQ could be deployed independently but would require logistic support \nand has only a limited step- up capability.  \nSERIAL 1 -01-13 \n1–01-13 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 JOINT FORCE FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS – RELATED TO JOINT FUNCTIONS  \nReference: AJP -3 (Edition 3 Ver 1 + UK Ele  Feb 2023) Conduct of Operations (Annex B ) \n13.1.  What are Joint Force Functional Elements?   In any joint operation, the \ncommander joint task force (JTF) may choose from a wide variety of joint and service \nspecific capabilities and combine them in various ways to perform joint functions and \naccomplish the mission. The operation plan/order describes the way forces and assets are \nused together to perform joint functions and tasks. The following list is not exhaustive: \n13.2.  Integrated Air and Missile Defence. Integrated air and missile defence is defined \nas all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile  threat or to nullify or reduce the \neffectiveness of hostile air action to protect  populations, territory and forces against the full \nspectrum of air and missile threats. The joint force air and missile defence commander is the \ncommander  with overall responsibility for air and missile defence; normally, the component  \ncommander with the preponderance of air and missile defence capability and the command, \ncontrol and communications capability to plan and execute  integrated air and missile \ndefence operations. They integrate and coordinate the air and missile defence assets of \neach force component into a coherent  joint air defence plan.  \n13.3.  Joint  Force Engineers  (JFEngr) .  Guided by the Joint Task Force Commander ’s \nCONOPS, the Joint Force Engineer controls all J oint Task Force Engineer assets and sets \ntheir priorities.  In particular, he should determine the balance between force support \n(enabling infrastructure) and combat support  (manoeuvre / protection) .  Joint Force Engineer \nstaff and force elements are likely to be some of the first enablers to deploy.  Subsequently, \nthe staff will be embedded within the JTFHQ.  \n13.4.  Joint  Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal  and Search (JFEOD) .  Joint explosive \nordnance disposal  and search is an operational explosive ordnance disposal /search \ncapability maintained by all 3 Services for use in their respective environments. However, \nenhanced synergy is achieved by C2 through the Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal Cell, \nfrom within the JTFHQ.   Often this is commanded by the JFEngr Commander.  \n13.5.  Joint  Helicopter Force .  A single joint helicopter force may be formed from \ncomponent  battlefield helicopters from the outset.  The Joint Helicopter Force Headquarters \nprovides a focus for the C2 of all battlefield helicopter force elements. The Joint Helicopter Force Commander may sit within the JTFHQ, in order to provide direct advice, or deploy within a stand -alone headquarters  or as part of the Air Component .   \n13.6.  Joint  Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear .  Joint Chemical, \nBiological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) elements provides CBRN protection support \nand C2 for operations.  It is an essentially modular organisation designed to address \ndifferent elements of the CBRN hazard and will be deployed on a threat based, task -\norganised basis. The headquarters elements, potentiall y with other multinational CBRN \nheadquarters, are likely to be located within the JTFHQ but could be subordinated to \ncomponent level. \n13.7.  Strategic Communication – STRATCOM .   The STRATCOM function has four \nareas : STRATCOM, Information Operations, Psychological Operations and Media \nOperations.  The STRATCOM cell provides the central staff for the STRATCOM function.  It \nSERIAL 1 -01-13 \nreceives and interprets the STRATCOM directiv e which is part of the Strategic  Planning \nGuidance.  Information Operations  is a staff func tion to analys e, plan, integrate and assess \ninformation ac tivities to create desired effec ts on the will, understanding and capability of \nadvers aries, potential adversaries and audiences in support of mission objectives.  \nPsychological Operations or PsyOps are planned ac tivities  using methods of communication \nand other means directed at approv ed audiences in order to influence perc eptions, attitudes \nand behaviours, affec ting the ac hievement of political and military objectives.  Media \nOperations is the capability responsible for promoting military aims and objec tives by \ncommunicating acc urate and truthful information to internal and external audiences  in a \ntimely  manner. \n13.8.

What are the fundamentals of Joint doctrine?  There are a number of common \ndoctrinal ideas that  underpin all Joint military activity.  These are : \n•Fighting Power.\n•Principles of War .\n•Behaviour / Audience- centric Approach.   (Key Tenet)1\n•Manoeuvrist Approach.   (Key Tenet )\n•Mission Command.   (Key Tenet)\n•Doctrinal Frameworks .\nFighting Power  (from JDP 0 -01) \n1.2. Fighting power determines the ability of our Armed Forces to operate and warfight. \nFighting power’s hierarchy consists of a pre -eminent moral component2 (the will), a \nconceptual component (the thought process) and a physical component (the means). This is \nshown in Figure 1.1 .  \n1.3. Moral component .  The moral component concerns the ability to get people to fight :  \nUltimately, it is humans that generate fighting power.  The moral component of fighting \npower focuses on the Armed Forces ’ offensive spirit, initiative and a determination to \naccomplish the mission.   It comprises of 7 elements:   \n•Leadership .\nLeader\nship is a variabl e\nc\nombination of example,\npersuasion andcompulsion. It is t\nhe\npr\nojection of personality\nand purpose to influencesubordinates to prevail in\ndemandi\nng\nc\nircumstances.\nLeadership at all levels is\nthe principal element i n\nm\naintaining mo rale\n•Followership .\nFol\nlowership is the act or\ncondition of followi ng an\nappoi\nnted leader. G ood\nf\nollowership is as vital as\nstrong leadership, and its\nbenefits achieve unity ofpurpose.\n1 Key Tenet  = main principle of doctrine.  \n2 Note: AJP -01 Para 3.2 states  “There are three components of fighting power, none of which can \nclaim precedence and each mutually supports and informs the others .” Figure 1. 1  Illustrating the 3 components of fighting power.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • Culture .  Comprising complex traditions,  practices, organisational structures, \nartefacts and unwritten norms, our  cultures underpin effective fighting power and our \nwarfighting ethos.   But they  are also the cause of deep- seated behaviours and cognitive \nbiases across all  ranks  creating behaviours  such as groupthink, tribalism, ‘can- do’ \nmentality, presentism, cultural blindness, and consent and evade mindsets . \n• Warfighting ethos.   Warfighting ethos is the vital moral, emotional and spiritual \ncapacity to overcome fear and cope with the visceral and highly ambiguous nature of war; \nit is crucial to instilling courage and human resilience in our personnel who are required to \nfight.  \n• Moral cohesion.  Moral cohesion underpins the moral courage to fight and keep on \nfighting. It is built on shared experiences, a common sense of worth, discipline and \ncollective identity. It is sustained by shared common values and standards . \n• Motivation. Motivation is a product of training, confidence in equipment, leadership, \nmanagement, reward, welfare, discipline and mutual respect. Motivation and morale are \ninterdependent. Motivation can be affected by external influences (including public \nopinion), which can reassure or erode morale.  \n• Moral integrity .  Moral integrity provides the foundations upon which both cohesion \nand motivation are built and requires individuals to understand right and wrong. It is \ninstilled by personal discipline, education and training, and reinforced through the values \nand standards expressed by each Service.  \n1.4. Conceptual Component  (the ideas  & thought process):  The conceptual component \nprovides a framework of thinking within which military personnel can develop understanding about both their profession and the activities that they may have to undertake. It has \nrelevance at all levels of operations and depends on the development and exploitation of \nhuman qualities such as critical thinking, challenge, diversity of thought, foresight, resilience \nand adaptability . It comprises of 3 elements:  \n• Strategic analysis and assessment .  Strategic analysis and assessment is the \nanalysis of current and future trends and plausible outcomes to provide the context for \nlong- term decision- making. It informs and supports the development of Defence policy \nand capability . \n• Concept development .  Concept development is the application of a deliberate \nmethodology to  explore, understand and define Defence problems; determine possible \nsolutions that guide how forces will operate; and influence the policies and capabilities \nthat are required to enable the force to achieve success.  \n• Doctrine .  Doctrine is defined as: the fundamental principles by which military forces \nguide their actions in support of objectives. It is authoritative advice but requires \njudgement in application.   Doctrine can be simply described as considered thought on the \nbest way of doing things now . \n1.5. Physical  component  (generate the means to fight):  The physical component of \nfighting power  provides  the means to fight.   It has 5  elements:  \n• Personnel . Defence’s success depends on its people; they are the critical \ncomponent of Defence capability . \n• Equipment . A credible fighting force depends upon sufficient and effective \nequipment, optimised and scaled according to strategic direction.  \n• Training and collective performance.  Conditioning personnel for adversity and the \nchanging character of warfare begins with initial training and continues through \ndemanding collective training. This should entail the right balance of live and simulated \ntraining and match the character of the likely operating environments as closely as \npossible.   Collective performance is characterised by the high levels of cohesion, \nconfidence and proficiency achieved by units and formations that have trained or \noperated together.  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Sustainability . The ability to sustain operations is an essential element to generati ng\nc\nredible and effective fighting power and which affects the moral as well as the physical\ncomponent. As such it is a principle of war.\n•Readiness. Most armed  forces and supporting capabilities are at varying states of\nreadiness (routinely measured in days and hours) consistent with the assessed risks and\nthreats. Readiness is defined as: the period measured from an initiation order to t he\nm\noment when the headquarters or unit is ready to perform its task from its peacetime\nlocation (permanent or forward deployed) or ready for deployment.\nPrinciples of War  \n1.6. The principles of war reflect war’s enduring nature within the context of the changing \ncharacter of warfare and inform and guide the way in which we apply the military instrument. \nThe principles of war are not an exhaustive list, nor are they rules to be rigidly followed, but \nthey do provide comprehensive considerations for planning and executing campaigns and operations. Underpinned by understanding and the three tenets of doctrine, their expression, \nemphasis and application change in relation to context.  \n1.7. Except for selection and maintenance of the aim, placed first as the master principle, \nthe relative importance of each of the principles will vary according to context. Applying them \nrequires judgement, common sense and intelligent interpretation. The rapidly changing \ncharacter of warfare, driven by the pervasiveness of information and pace of technological \nchange, informs their contemporary relevance and, by extension, the evolution of two of the principles: ‘concentration of effects’ replacing ‘concentration of force’; and ‘integration’ \nreplacing ‘cooperation’.  \n1.8. The 10 principles of war  from JDP 0 -01 are summarised below . \nThe 10 Principles of War: ( JDP 0 -01 (6\nth Ed)) \n1. Selection and maintenance of the aim .  Regarded as the master principle of war,\nselection and maintenance of the aim provides focus. It enables military strategy and an\noutcome -focused execution at all levels of command. It is a reference point to assess\nprogress, prevents unnecessary activity and conserves resources .\n2. Maintenance of morale.   Maintenance of morale provides the will to fight. Hi gh\nm\norale is characterised by steadfastness, courage, confidence and sustained hope.\nMorale manifests itself as staying power and resolve, as well as the will to prevail despit e\npr\novocation and adversity.  It is a product of inspired political and military leadership; the\nlegitimacy of operations; a shared sense of purpose and values; well -being; confidence i n\nequi\npment; and training that forges fighting spirit, moral cohesion and calculated risk\ntaking without fear of failure.\n3. Offensive action.   Underpinned by fighting spirit, offensive action implies  a\nv\nigorous, incisive approach to exploiting opportunities and seizing the initiative. The\nprinciple of offensive action is reflected in assertive and confident campaigning thatconfronts threats early and proactively .\n4. Security .  Security entails balancing the likelihood of loss against achievi ng\nobj\nectives. Skill in command is, therefore, a foundation of security. It is a shield that c an\nhel\np conserve fighting power and affords freedom of action, when and where required to\nachiev e objectives. It demands managing risk, protecting high -value assets (including data\nand networks) and resilience\nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 5. Surprise .  Surprise, in its direct meaning, presupposes the unexpected. Whether\nachieved through physical or virtual methods, or a combination of both, surprise achieves\na cognitive effect – a feeling of relative confusion, or perhaps shock – that can undermi ne\nan op\nponent’s cohesion and morale.\n6. Concentration of effect .  A commander must balance the concentrated delivery of\nlethal and non- lethal capabilities at critical points and times and increasingly at greater\nrange and dispersal to realise effect. This must be done in concert with other national\ninstruments  to generate the most appropriate blend of hard and soft power\n7. Economy of effort .  Economy of effort may be described as the effective a nd\nef\nficient application of the components of fighting power: conceptual, moral and physical.\nCommanders must prioritise resources between all campaigns, operations and activities.\nEconomy of effort is best summarised as creating the right effect, in the right place, at t he\nr\night time, with the appropriate resources .\n8. Flexibility .  Flexibility is the ability to change readily to meet new circumstances  and\nc\nomprises the adaptability, versatility, resilience and responsiveness of the whole force –\nboth mental and physical aspects. Really flexible organisations are highly responsive.\nResponsiveness is a measure of speed of action, reaction and of how quickly the initiativ e\nc\nan be seized or regained. Adaptability is an increasingly important aspect of flexibility.\nAdaptability is not solely adjusting to new external conditions or responding toadversaries; it is also about our ability to learn rapidly and respond to internal stimuli to\nchange.\n9. Integration .  To integrate is to combine or be combined to form a whole. Integrati on\nhas\n an amplifying effect that must support and not hinder the adaptability of the force. It\nmay be likened to the connective tissue that knits all the parts of the force together whilst\nretaining the benefit of diverse perspectives and approaches.  The effectiveness  and\nef\nficiency of the force is improved through mutual trust and goodwill; a common aim;  and\ni\nntegration across operational domains and through strategic, operational and tactical\nlevels of operations. Integration is therefore closely associated with the principles ofconcentration of effect and economy of effort.\n10. Sustainability .  Sustainability of a fighting force is a critical enabler of fighti ng\npow\ner’s moral and physical components and helps to enable freedom of action.   It is\nanchored on a resilient and capable strategic base at the heart of a global support\nnetwork.  Sustainability directly influences the tempo, duration and intensity of activities,\nand exploited effectively it allows constant pressure to lessen an adve rsary’s will to fight. It\nis an enabler of operational agility and reflects our preparedness and resolve, andtherefore contributes to deterrence.\nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 NATO Principles of Joint and Multinational Operations  (AJP -01) \n1.9. NATO produce similar but slightly different version of the UK P rinciples of War.  \nThese are called the Principles of Joint and Multinational Operations.  They  are equivalent to, \nand closely aligned with, the UK  principles of war , however , there are some variances due to \ndifferent emphases.  \nThe 12 Principles of Joint and Multinational Operations (AJP -01 Para 3.69)  \nUnity of Effort.  Unity of effort emphasizes the requirement to ensure all means are \ndirected to a common goal. Military forces achieve this principally through unity of \ncommand. As part of a comprehensive approach, unity of effort binds all the parts of the \ncoalition together whilst retaining the benefit of diverse perspectives and approaches. It \nenables the integration and convergence of effects horizontally, across the Alliance and \npartners, and vertically, through the strategic, operational and tactical levels of operations. \nTo achieve such unity of effort, it is essential to plan, communicate and coordinate at all \nlevels and with all actors  involved in NATO activities and operations. It will require a \nflexible approach towards establishing shared objectives amongst NATO, partners, \ninternational organizations, non -governmental organizations, private sector and other \nstakeholders, based on the principles of civil- military interaction . \nDefinition of objectives . Operations must be focused towards clearly defined and \ncommonly understood objectives that contribute to attaining the end state. Understanding \nis central to providing insight and foresight to define effective objectives. Objectives must \nmaintain the legal and moral legitimacy of a campaign and the force. To ensure strategic \ncoherence the military instrument must be used proportionately and discriminately in \nrelation to other instru ments of power with an understanding that negative actions can \nhave serious political and strategic effects. By correctly selecting and defining objectives, \nit focuses the force on what is achievable and decisive, thereby supporting the principles \nof unity  of effort, freedom of action, concentration and economy of effort.  \nMaintenance of morale.  All forms of competition are human activity, with psychology \nbeing key to success and failure. Maintenance of morale provides the will to fight. High \nmorale is derived from fighting power and is characterized by steadfastness, courage, \nconfidence and sustained hope. Morale manifests itself as will and resolve, which will \ndrive the force to successfully achieve its objectives. It requires confidence in the \nsuperiority of information and equipment, inspiring leadership, tight cohesion and is \nsustained by the belief that the nation supports the force. It also demands freedom of \naction, taking and retaining the initiative, and controlling the narrative.  \nInitiative.  Competition involves the interplay between initiative and response. Achieving \nobjectives demands dictating the course of events in a competitive situation. To hold the \ninitiative is the ability to set or dictate the terms of action throughout the operation. \nMaintaining the initiative results in relentless cognitive pressure on the adversary, \ndegrading their morale and decision- making. Furthermore, it forces the adversary to \nrespond by trying to protect themselves; such a reactive posture is dif ficult to recover from \nand usually leads to defeat. Gaining the initiative requires relentless determination to succeed and an ability to impose one’s will on the adversary, to do the unexpected and \nachieve surprise and delegate the freedom of action for s ubordinates to exploit \nopportunities. Initiative is dependent on the other principles being applied in unison.  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Freedom of action .  Freedom of action is minimizing restrictions to enable a subordinate \nto use their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity and judgement to achieve their \nobjectives. Freedom of action requires a disciplined offensive spirt and it enables the \nflexibility fo r subordinate commanders to make timely decisions within the context of their \nhigher commander’s intent. Rather than constantly awaiting further orders, freedom of action is a precondition for successfully maintaining and exploiting the initiative. Freedom  \nof action across all levels of command allows the force to adapt quicker to a rapidly \nchanging operating environment, and to deal with unforeseen problems that are inherent \nin operations. Training, mutual trust and understanding, simple plans and clear, c oncise \norders allows commanders to delegate the maximum freedom of action in line with their subordinates’ ability and the context of the mission. \nOffensive spirit .  Offensive spirit delivers the benefits inferred by purposeful action rather \nthan inaction. Offensive spirit implies an incisive approach, with a willingness to understand and accept political and military risk, to seize, maintain and exploit the \ninitiative  in line with one’s freedom of action. Critically, offensive spirt does not preclude \ndefensive action. Central to offensive spirt is maintenance of morale and definition of objectives.  \nConcentration.  In an increasingly transparent and lethal operating environment it is ever \nmore difficult to maintain security and survival. Concentration is therefore not synonymous \nwith the physical massing of forces for a decisive action, but concentration of effects created from a dispersed force. Integrating and coordinating actions across the \noperational domains in concert with allies and partners will achieve mass. Through \nconcentration of actions and effects, it is possible to affect a rival’s capac ity for decision -\nmaking through imposing multiple dilemmas, gaining the initiative and achieving objectives, whilst also maximizing economy of effort. Effective concentration demands \nunity of effort, definition of objectives and the ability to sustain the mass.  \nEconomy of Effort .  Concentration must be delivered economically and precisely, \ntargeting the right objects in the right space at the right time with the appropriate \nresources. Of all the principles, it is the most difficult to apply due to its close interdependence with t he ever -changing conditions of the operating environment. \nPrecision in the definition of objectives, surprise and security prevents wasted resource \nand effort by allowing the concentration of effort to be on what is decisive  \nSecurity.  Security limits vulnerability to hostile activities, threats and surprise. It is a \nshield that can help conserve fighting power and affords the initiative and freedom of \naction, when and where required, to achieve objectives. It requires unity of effort, \nunderstanding the points of influence, particularly vulnerabilities, risk management and \nresilience.  \nSecurity contributes to preparedness but does not demand  over-committing resources to \nguard against every threat or possibility, thereby diminishing relative fighting power.  \nLack of security, or a false interpretation of the principle of security, leads directly to being surprised and loss of initiative. Commanders should anticipate the effects of being surprised and make appropriate contingency plans to safeguard their freedom of action. \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Surprise.  Surprise, achieved through unexpected actions, achieves a cognitive effect – a \nfeeling of relative confusion, or perhaps shock – that can undermine the adversary’s \ncohesion and morale. Using surprise is a significant way of seizing the initiative and may \nbe a critical  pre-condition for success. It is transient and must be exploited rapidly. \nDeception is closely related to surprise and requires deliberate measures to mislead targeted decision- makers into behaving in a manner advantageous to the achievement of \none’s objective. Surprise is also dependent on security. \nFlexibility .  A flexible force is one that has the ability to be highly responsive to changing \ncircumstances. Plans and procedures should be sufficiently flexible to respond to the \nunexpected and they should empower commanders with maximum freedom of action. \nThis allows the force to adapt to a situation and learn lessons more quickly than a rival, \nthereby gaining the initiative. Flexibility is enabled by a clear definition of objectives, \nfreedom of action and sustainability.  \nSustainability.  Operations are demanding and often brutal and visceral, placing extreme \nphysical and psychological demands on personnel and requiring the constant care of people and equipment. A force that lacks sustainability and resilience is rarely successful. \nPersonnel, equipment, systems and effects must be sustained and maintained to prevent \nculmination and to maintain resilience. The ability to generate and re -generate, avoiding \nshortages and waste, maintains a commander’s flexibility and freedom of  action to \nmaintain the initiative, while also inspiring confidence and enhancing morale.  \nThe Behaviour -centric / Audience- centric Approach  \n1.10.  A behaviour -centric / audience- centric approach recognises that people are at the \nheart of competition; it is their decisions and behaviours that determine how competition is conducted and resolved. A successful behaviour -centric / audience- centric approach begins \nwith commanders being clear about the outcome they seek; they need to study the audiences relevant to \nachieving the identified \noutcome and analyse the effects they wish to \ncreate on those target \naudiences. Only then \nshould the mix of joint \ncapabi lities be \ndetermined to create physical, cognitive and virtual effects across \nthe operational \ndomains to affect the \nunderstanding, \nphysical capability, will and cohesion of the \naudiences to achieve a \nsuccessful outcome.\n   \n1.11.  Activities can \nbe conducted by, with or through civil and \ncross government partners  in a \ncomprehensive approach. What is Public\nAn Individual, group or \nentity who are aware of \nactivities that may affect \nthe attainment of the end \nstate.\nStakeholders\nAn Individual, group or \nenity who can affect or is \naffected by the attainment \nof the end state.\nActors\nAn Individual, group or \nenity whose actions \nare affecting the \nattainment of the end \nstate.\nFigure 1 .2 The Three Categories that makeup an audience  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 8 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 important is for commanders and staff to work out how to orchestrate the joint force and, \nwhere required capabilities lie outside the joint force, synchronise all the relevant levers. \nUnderstanding the audiences is the major consideration.  \n1.12.  Audiences . An audience is: “ an individual, group or entity  whose interpretation of \nevents and subsequent behaviour may affect the attainment of the end state” .  Audiences \nare segmented into three general categories –  public , stakeholders and actors – \ndepending on their ability to affect our outcomes. A sophisticated understanding provides the \nfocus for planning and executing activity to create or maintain the attitudes that constitute \nbehaviour. Commanders, with an understanding of the higher commander’s intent and the \nstrategic narrative, can then conduct target audience analysis to identify the effects that they \nwish to create.  \n• Stakeholder .  A stakeholder is an audience who can affect or is affected by the \nattainment of the end state. The Alliance’s activities encourage or develop supportive stakeholders to become partners, whilst discouraging or denying unsupportive or hostile \nstakeholders from becoming actors.  \n• Public.   A public is an audience who is aware of activities that may affect the \nattainment of the end state. Public’s attitude may range from hostile to supportive.  \n• Actors .  An actor is an audience whose actions are currently affecting the attainment \nof the end state. The terms shown in the table below  represent the spectrum  of actors  \nthat is  commonly  used in doctrine.  \n \nName  Description  of Actors  \nAlliance  The relationship that results from a formal agreement between two or \nmore nations for broad, long- term objectives that further the common \ninterests of the members.  \nPartner  An actor belonging to a declared, presumed or recognized friendly \nnation, organization, faction or group sharing a common goal.  \nNeutral  An actor whose characteristics, behaviour, origin or nationality indicate \nthat it is neither supporting nor opposing either side.  \nRival  Actors who are competing with another actor, for the same objective, to \nachieve advantage, without hostile intent, and compete in accordance \nwith the rules -based international order. Rivals are usually found in the \nrivalry zone of the continuum of competit ion. \nAdversary  An actor whose intentions or interests are opposed to those of friendly \nparties and against which legal coercive political, military or civilian \nactions may be envisaged and conducted. They may have many \ndifferent motivations and may be subject to a broad range of influences \nand are usually found in the confrontation zone of the continuum of \ncompetition.  \nEnemy  An actor whose actions are hostile and against which the legal use of \narmed force is authorized. Enemies operate in the armed conflict zone of \nthe continuum of competition.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 9 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.13.  Analysing and Categorising Audiences .  The position of individuals and groups \nwithin the range of audiences is not fixed.  In Figure 1.3  attitudes and behaviours are \ndepicted on the horizontal axis, while audience classification is shown on the vertical axis. \nThe interrelated factors of changes in the audience’s will and capability generally determine \nwhether an audience is an actor, stakeholder or public. A range of effects can undermine or \nstrengthen an audience’s will. The capability of an audience can be developed, purchased, \nenabled, as well as being neutralized, denied or destroyed. Generally, changing an \naudience’s capability is quic ker and more readily achievable than changing attitudes, which \nrequires long- term, persistent engagement.   \n1.14.  Narrative- led Execution. Every action creates an informational effect and, via the \ninformation environment, that effect will influence multiple audiences, be they global, national \nor within a theatre of operations. The information that audiences receive is often cluttered, so \nthey use narratives to give meaning to actions and facts. A narrative will often compete with \nother narratives to give the fact its meaning. If the facts are not irrefutable, it is often the credibility of the narrative that is decisiv e in influencing the perception of different audiences. \nTherefore, to effectively influence audiences, it requires consistency of actions, images and words; this consistent message is the narrative and is supported by narrative- led execution.  \nThe Manoeuvrist  Approach (JDP 0 -01) \n1.15.  Overview .  The manoeuvrist approach is one in which shattering the enemy’s overall \ncohesion and will to fight is paramount, rather than just destroying his forces and equipment.  \nIt is an indirect approach which emphasises targeting the enemy’s moral component of his \nfighting power rather than the physical.  Central to the concept is the need to seize, retain and exploit the initiative.  This approach is most effective when it is used in conjunction with \nmission command.  The manoeuvrist approach aims to apply strength against identified \nvulnerabilities , to induce shock, through surprise, shock action, and destruction, leading to \nan enemy’s collapse, which is followed by friendly force exploitation.   \n1.16.  Requirements.  The Manoeuvrist Approach, enabled by Mission Command, has two \nspecific requirements: an attitude of mind and understanding of the enemy’s vulnerabilities.  \nFigure 1 .3 Audiences in the operating environment  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 10 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • Attitude of Mind.   \nThe Manoeuvrist \nApproach requires an \nattitude of mind that \nseeks indirect solutions \nto reduce the enemy’s \nwill to fight, by pitching \nour strength against \nenemy vulnerability, \nrather than strength.  \n• Understanding .  \nThe second \nrequirement is an \nunderstanding of the \nenemy’s vulnerabilities, \nboth before contact \nand as they appear \nand evolve during \nbattle. Centre of gravity \nanalysis can be a useful \ntool for this. The \nManoeuvrist Approach guides us to find, attack, and exploit these vulnerabilities in an \nenemy’s strength.  \n1.17.  Approach .  The manoeuvrist approach seeks to out -think and outmanoeuvre \ncompetitors and potential adversaries physically, cognitively and virtually across  the \noperational domains3. The manoeuvrist approach seeks to seize and hold the initiative, \nshape understanding, and undermine will and fracture cohesion.  \n• Seizing and holding the initiative. Seizing and holding the initiative aims to impose \nmultiple and simultaneous  problems on the enemy .  This advantage is achieved by \ncreating confusion and overwhelming their ability to make decisions and act coherently. \nSeizing the initiative is intrinsically linked to applying the tenet of mission command. \nMaintaining the initiative allows the commander t o dictate the course of events and \nmaintain relentless pressure on the unsupportive audience. Seizing and maintaining the \ninitiative requires the application of several factors. These factors are mutually reinforcing \nand should not be applied in isolation.  \no Pre-emption . Pre -emption involves seizing an opportunity to deny actor an \nadvantage before they act, or preventing a stakeholder from acting. It denies them the initiative and frustrates their plan. Its success lies in understanding, taking \ncalculated risk, speed of execution and subsequent exploitation.  \no Surprise . Surprise is a principle of multinational operations and is one of the \nmost significant contributors to military success at all levels. Surprise involves using \nambiguity, concealment, deception, originality and audacity to confuse and disrupt \ndecision- making. Surprise is a potent cognitive weapon, causing shock through \nunexpected action in time, location and operational domain.  \no Simultaneity. Simultaneity seeks to overload the decision- making of actors \nand stakeholders by confronting them with a concentration of simultaneous threats, which is achieved through the integration and synchronization of actions and effects. \nThis will overload their ability to understand the situation or prioritize responses, \nthereby creating a dilemma that effectively paralyzes their command and control. By \nacting simultaneously, the effect is cumulative; they are threatened by so many \n \n3 See SOHB Serial 01-01-03  Manoeuvrist Approach (JDP 0-01)\nManoeuvrist \nApproach\nSeizing and \nholding the \ninitiative\nUndermining Will \n& Fracturing \nCohesion\nShaping \nUnderstandingAttitude \nof MindUnderstandingRequirements\nPre-emption\nSurprise\nSimultaneity\nTempo\nExploitation\nDislocation\nDisruptionA\np\np\nr\no\na\nc\nhMethods\nFigure 1 .4 Manoeuvrist Approach Schematic  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 11 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 concurrent threats that they are denied the ability to concentrate on one problem at a \ntime or even establish priorities between them.  \no Tempo . Tempo is the rate of action relative to another audience. Speed and \nquality of decision- making is key to gaining and maintaining a favourable tempo. \nImportantly, tempo is relative and can be achieved by slowing down the hostile \nactor’s decision- action cy cle through methods like surprise, simultaneity or disruption \nof key capacities.  \no Exploitation . Exploitation is the use of successes or opportunities to \nmaximize advantages or gains. It means seizing opportunities created by activities to achieve an objective, exploiting points of influence, or directly fulfilling part of the \nhigher commander’s int ent. Success must be ruthlessly exploited to maintain the \ninitiative, extend and expand its effects, and accelerate the collapse of the \nunsupportive actor’s will. Opportunities for exploitation may occur only fleetingly and \ncommanders at all levels should anticipate and seize opportunities as they occur, \nwhich makes mission command critical to exploiting the initiative.  \n• Shaping understanding. The manoeuvrist approach seeks to manipulate \nperceptions and understanding to produce favourable attitudes and behavioural \noutcomes in selected audiences. The perception of failure is the best mechanism to \npromote actual failure. Understanding shapes an audience’s attitude by influencing how \nthey think, feel and respond to information or events, and ultimately the actor’s will to continue contesting a situation. Therefore, reducing an audience’s ability to understand \nthe situation ser ves to weaken their moral component.  \n• Undermining will and fracturing cohesion . Will and cohesion are indivisible. Will is \nthe determination to persist in the face of adversity .  It has two aspects: intent and \nresilience. Cohesion is linked to all the components of fighting power. Our  own will and \ncohesion must be protected from the actions of adversaries. Will and cohesion can be \ntargeted through dislocation , disruption and ultimately destruction . \no Dislocation. Dislocation denies an actor the ability to bring strengths to bear \nby not accepting the premise or terms of the engagement. Dislocation is about \nensuring that the unsupportive actor’s strengths are unavailable, focused in the \nwrong place, or rendered ineffective or irrelevant.  \no Disruption. Disruption denies an unsupportive actor’s ability to join together  \ntheir actions by targeting critical capabilities and other points of influence upon which \nthey depend. This is attained by neutralization or destruction, which can be either \nattritional or annihilatory  (destroy)  in nature. Disruption on multiple points of influence \ncan create cognitive paralysis.  \n1.18.  Note:  NATO AJP- 01 combines the two aspects of “shaping understanding” and \n“undermining will and cohesion”  mentioned above into a single aspect called “ Targeting the \nmoral component of Fighting power ” - achieved  by shaping understanding and undermining \nwill and cohesion”.  \nMission Command  \n1.19.  A commander’s primary responsibility is to accomplish the missions and tasks that \ncontribute to specific objectives in line with his  higher commander’s intent and the strategic \nnarrative. This requires the fusion of:  \n• leadership , derived from the leadership culture (that is part of the moral component);  \n• command authority , as allocated formally to a commander through orders and \ndirectives; and  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 12 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •control , the manner in which the commander manages and directs forces  and\nf\nunctions consistent with command authority .\n1.20.  Mission Command Overview .  How a military force blends leadership, command \nauthority and control is fundamental to how it orchestrates fighting power. Mission command \noffers a philosophy of command that advocates centralised planning that includes provision \nof clear guidance and intent with decentralised execution.  This is based on mission-type orders; a style that describes the ‘what’ needs to be achieved, without necessarily \nprescribing the ‘how’.  Mission command is based on empowered leadership, which enables \ndecisions to be made by those best placed to make them, exploiting opportunities that \nemerge. Mission command offers a significant advantage when applied correctly, enabling the joint force to overcome a rival in the most chaotic and demanding circumstances by maximizing initiative to seiz e opportunities . \n1.21.  Mission Command Fundamentals. Successful mission command is guided by the \nfundamentals of trust  and mutual understanding. \n•Trust . Trust is a prerequisite of command at all levels. The level of trust between the\ncommander and a subordinate dictates the level in which the subordinate can and will\n be\nf\nree to decide how to execute their mission and task within the framework of the higher\ncommander’s intent and assigned mission and includes:\nowhere and how to establish their main effort;\nowhat risks to take; and\nohow to synchronize their activities.\nThe spirit of mission command requires a bond of trust between superiors, subordinates and peers that will develop through shared experience. While trust must be earned and \nnot demanded, the default should be for commanders to trust their superiors and \nsubordinates.   \n•M\nutual Understanding . Like trust, mutual understanding is established over tim e\nand t\nhrough applying common training and doctrine. The practice of acting in accordanc e\nw\nith the higher commander’s intent, even when communications are limited, can only be\nsuccessful if there is a high degree of unity in thinking and action at all levels ofoperations. Mutual understanding builds trust. Mutual understanding is also based on\ncommon doctrine and command philosophy and so cannot be assumed when operati\nng\ni\nn a multinational, inter -agency and civilian context.Trust\nMutual \nUnderstandingPeopleMission\nTimely & \nEffective \nDecision \nMakingUnity of \nEffort\nDecentralised \nExecution\nFigure 1 .5 Illustrating the fundamentals and principles of Mission Command  (Adapted AJP -01 Fig 4.2)  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 13 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.22.  Mission Command Principles . The following principles provide a continuous cycle \nof unity of effort, timely and effective decision- making, and decentralized execution:  \n• Unity of effort . To achieve unity of effort, it is essential to plan, communicate and \ncoordinate at all levels and with all actors involved in a comprehensive approach to crisis. \nAchieving unity of effort is often complicated by the variety of international military and \nnon-military actors involved, the lack of command -and-control  arrangements between \nthem, and varying views of the objectives or end state. Some international organizations \nand non- governmental organizations may refuse to cooperate directly w ith military forces. \nThis will require a flexible approach towards establishing processes or bodies to share \ninformation between the involved international organizations a  \n• Timely and effective decision -making. Successful command requires timely and \neffective decision- making at all levels. Mission command empowers subordinate \ncommanders, who are best placed to make decisions, the authority to do so. Timely \ndecisions allow the Alliance’s forces to gain and maintain the initiative .  Developing an \nintuitive understanding of when to decide is as integral a component of the art of \ncommand as knowing from where to command. The essential elements to any decision-\nmaking process are detailed in Allied Joint Publication (AJP) -3, Allied Joint  Doctrine for \nthe Conduct of Operations.  \n• Decentralized execution. Decentralized execution enables subordinates the \nfreedom of action to act independently, which enables agility in changing situations and \nthe ability to exploit opportunities in accordance with their overall objective. C ommanders \nmust delegate the maximum freedom of action in line with their subordinates’ ability. This \nis affected by a commander's style of command. Where control measures are \nestablished, these have a role in reducing the complementary need for direct comm and \nstyle. If control measures are  ambiguous, weak or absent, more direct command is \ninevitably required. These control measures only specify how a mission will be executed if \nthere are political, legal or military restraints, to enable coordination and synchronization \nof actions on the objective. Decentralized execution depends upon:  \no commanders ensuring that their subordinates understand the intent, their own \ncontributions and the context including the narrative within which they are to act;  \no commanders exercising minimum control over their subordinates, consistent \nwith the context and nature of the mission, and the subordinates’ experience and ability, while retaining responsibility for their actions;  \no subordinates having a sound understanding of the overall plan, what objective \nthey are contributing to, the effect they are to create, and why;  \no subordinates being allocated sufficient resources to carry out their missions, \nand subordinates deciding for themselves how best to act on their superior’s intent, \nincluding where and how to establish their main effort and what risks to take;  \no subordinates communicating their plan to the commander to ensure \nsituational awareness; and \no subordinates having the willingness to accept the trust placed in them, and \nthe initiative to act within any freedom of action given.  \nDoctrinal Frameworks:  \n1.23.  Doctrine produces conceptual frameworks  as tools  to aid commander’s \nunderstanding and help design and plan operations.   They include analytical frameworks \nsuch as PEMSSII -PT covered in Serial 3 -01-06.  In addition,  there are operations , functional, \ngeographic and joint function framewor ks. Selection of the best doctrinal framework to \nemploy will depend on the situation,  the needs of the force and the type of operation.  \n \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 14 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 NATO Operations  Framework (AJP 01)  \n1.24.  The operations framework describes tactical operations as : \n• Shaping (tasks  create the conditions required to allow the decisive tasks .) \n• Decisive (tasks that are those essential to achieve the objective. ) \n• or Supporting  (tasks that enable and support to ensure f reedom  of action.)  \nThe operations framework describes their purpose and links them to the commander’s \nmanoeuvre plan. It sets the operating scheme and desired result. The commander uses the \noperations framework to synchronize their forces’ activities in time and space according to \nthe objective  (purpose) . It enables a clear view of relationships between the effects and \nobjectives. It also enhances the forces’ focus on the end state and avoids mission creep.  \nFunctional Framework (AJP -01) \n1.25.  The Functional Framework is also known as the Tactical Framework in UK Land \nDoctrine .  The Functional Framework takes the 4 core functions of manoeuvre and provides \na framework for a scheme of manoeuvre : \n• Find (The find function concerns discerning the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses  \nin the broadest sense, as well as identifying and locating specific capabilities and vulnerabilities to target .) \n• Fix (To gain freedom of action, a commander must deny the enemy the opportunity \nto achieve their goals and put them in a reactive frame of mind. ) \n• Strike  (The strike function exploits the freedom of action created by fixing.)  \n• Exploit  (To exploit is to turn opportunities to advantage. Exploitation may expand the \nscope of an engagement beyond its original objective.)  \nGeographic Framework (AJP -01) \n1.26.  Geography is important because it describes where an operation’s tactical actions \nand their effects  occur. The Geographic Framework describes the ‘where and when’ of \nemploying actions. In this framework, deep and rear operations are defined by the close operational engagement space around the joint force. The geographic framework is: \n• Deep (The purpose of deep operations is to fracture the cohesion of an opponent \nand establish an advantage before conducting close operations . Examples are \nInformation Activities , ISTAR, Fires, Deep manoeuvre and they will invariably require \nclose coordination with all  components of a joint force. ) \n• Close (Close operations occur at short range,  their effects are immediate and \ntangible.  Close operations occur once the conditions for success have been set by \ndeep operations. ) \n• Rear (Rear operations ensure freedom of action by protecting and sustaining a force. \nThey also maintain freedom of action for uncommitted forces. Although rear \noperations include administration, logistics and protection, their effect is much wider; \nwithin the overall scheme of manoeuvre, they create the conditions for successful \ndeep and close operations. ) \nEven in a non -linear engagement space, the concepts of deep, close and rear, and a sense \nof range and proximity, aid understanding. When used in combination with other \nframeworks, they provide a powerful method to help visualize, organize and integrate act ivity \nacross the operational domains, and the electromagnetic and acoustic spectra.  \n \n \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 15 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Joint Function Framework (AJP -01) \n1.27.  The joint function framework assists commanders to integrate political, military \nand civilian actions through the operational domains. The joint functions describe and \ncategorise the required detailed capabilities of the force.  They  are explained in the table \nbelow.  In any operation these joint functions are to be considered, although each \nindividual functions’ amount of contribution, its significance and its demand will vary. The \nJoint Function Framework is also known as the Tactical Functions  in UK Land Doctrine.  \n1.28.  The joint function framework uses a combination of manoeuvre, fires, information \nand CIMIC to affect the audience’s attitude and behaviour. It is 'informed and directed' \nby the joint functions of command and control and intelligence, and 'supported' by the \njoint functions of sustainment and force protection, as shown in Figure 1.5 below . \nNATO Joint Functions (AJP -3 Para 1.41 – 1.60) (Summary)  \nJoint functions provide a sound framework of related capabilities and activities grouped \ntogether to assist commanders to integrate, synchronize, and direct various capabilities \nand activities in joint operations.  \n1. Command and control . C2 encompasses the exercise of authority and direction by \na commander over assigned and attached forces to accomplish the mission.  \n2. Intelligence. The role of intelligence is to contribute to a continuous and coordinated \nunderstanding of the operating environment, to support commanders by identifying \nconditions required to achieve objectives; avoiding undesired effects; and assessing the \nimpact of adversary, friendly and neutral actors on the commanders’ concept of \noperations. Intelligence is therefore an aid to provide situational awareness, develop \nunderstanding and is a critical tool for decision- making \n3. Manoeuvre . The principal purpose of manoeuvre is to gain positional advantage in \nrespect to the adversary from which force can be threatened or applied. Manoeuvre seeks \nto render adversary’s  incapable of resisting effectively throughout all dimensions of the \nJOA effectively by shattering their cohesion rather than destroying each of his components through incremental attrition.  \n4. Fires.  Fires creates effects on a target. They may be applied directly or indirectly to \ncreate a wide range of physical and psychological effects by degrading capability and \nshattering cohesion. Fires are often delivered by joint assets and may include naval f ire, \nland direct fire, land indirect fire and aerial fire.  \n5. Civil -military cooperation. CIMIC is a joint function comprising a set of capabilities \nintegral to supporting the achievement objectives and enabling NATO commands to \nparticipate effectively in a broad spectrum of C ivil-Military Interaction (CMI)  with diverse \nnon-military actors.  \n6. Information. The use of information is critical to decision making processes. Actors’ \nperception within the operating environment is dependent on information available to them. Agility and proactive action in the information environment is critical to operational \nsuccess.  \n7. Sustainment . Forces and their fighting power need to be sustained through all \nphases of operations. Sustainment provides for the comprehensive provision of personnel; \nlogistics; medical; and general MILENG support required to maintain combat power \nthroughout all phas es of the operation.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 16 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 8. Force protection. Force protection is a function aimed at minimizing the \nvulnerability of personnel, facilities, equipment, materiel, operations and activities from \nthreats and hazards to preserve freedom of action and operational effectiveness thereby \ncontributing to mission success. The fundamental elements of force protection are \nsecurity, military engineering support to force protection, air defence, medical force \nprotection and force health protection, consequence management, r esilience, tactical area \nof responsibility control, and CBRN defence.  \nJoint Action  Framework  (AJP-3) \n1.29.  Joint Action Overview .  While tactical commanders possess the means to conduct \nmilitary activities at their level, their capabilities are most effective when integrated and synchronized across the joint force.  The conceptual framework that permits force integration \nand synchronization is called joint action.\n Joint Action is neither a new capability nor an \nactivity in its own right.  Instead, it is a framework for considering the integration, \ncoordination and synchronisation of all military activity within the battlespace.  It is described \nas: “the deliberate use and orchestration of military capabilities and activities to affect an \nactor’s understanding, capability and will, and the cohesion between them. ” \n• Understanding . An adversary’s understanding underpins their decision- making; \nhowever, it is not absolute and does not endure. Their understanding of the situation \n– the competing narratives, relative strengths, effectiveness and vulnerabilities –  \naffects perception and, therefore, their will to act.  \n• Capability. Capability depends on a physical capacity for action and applying it \neffectively and in context. While there is often an advantage conferred by quantity \nand quality, other factors, such as prioritizing resources are at the commander’s \ndiscretion and therefore subject to influence.  \n• Will. The will to act or resist at the operational and tactical level is based on the unity \nof communities of interest or armed groups, fighting spirit, morale and cohesion. Will \ncan be affected physically (through activities like fires) and psychologically (t hrough Figure 1 .6 Illustrating the Joint Function Framework  Fires Manoeuvre\nCivil -military \ncooperation \n(Outreach )InformationInfluence  \nattitude & \nbehaviourCommand & Control Intelligence\nSustainment Force ProtectionActionsInformed &\ndirected by\nSupported by\nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 17 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 perception or surprise).

This summary is taken from JDP 0-1 0 UK Maritime Power 5th Edition Oct 2017 (paras in \nbrackets)and is coherent with the MAJCSC Maritime Reader Edition 5 (2025). \n2.\n2. Maritime Power .  This is defined as: “ the ability to apply maritime military capabilities \nat and from the sea to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events. ” (Para 1.3)  \n2.3. The Maritime Environment .  This comprises; “ the high seas, exclusive economic \nzones and territorial seas … multidimensional as maritime forces operate above on and \nbelow the surface of the sea”.  (Para 1.6)  \n2.4. The Littoral Region.  This is defined as: “ those land areas (and their adjacent areas \nand associated air space) that are susceptible to engagement and influence from the sea.  Conversely, it also includes those areas of the sea susceptible to engagement from the land, \nfrom both land and air forces ”.  (Para 1.6).  \n2.5. Fundamental UK Maritime Power Roles.  The three fundamental UK maritime \npower roles are: (Para 1.7)  \nWar Fighting  Maritime Security  Defence \nEngagement  \nTHE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT  \n2.6. Dimensions of the Maritime Environment .  There are five dimensions of the \nmaritime environment.  \n•Economic.  The maritime environment acts as the principal means of movement forover 80% of the world’s trade by volume and 70% by value.  Fossil fuels, minerals\nand fish are important resources in the maritime environment. Submarine cables\ncarry 99% of the globe’s internet traffic.   Access to the ocean is therefore of\nparamount concern to all the world’s major economies.  (from Para 2.4)\n•Physical .  The sea covers over 70% of the globe’s surface ranging from th\ne deep\nw\naters of the open oceans to the shallower littoral regions adjacent to the land.\nAlong with space and cyberspace, the oceans outside of state authority make up t he\ngl\nobal commons and  no state may legitimately subject any part of the high seas to its\nsovereignty.  Global choke points  (eg Straits of Hormuz, Bab al -Mandab) funnel\ninternational shipping and restrict freedom of navigation.   (from Para 2.8)\n•Political .  The extension of coastal state jurisdiction may increase the likelihood of\ndisputes both between bordering states and also between coastal states and fl ag\ns\ntates exercising freedom of navigation; maritime power plays a vital role in resisti ng\nf\nurther restrictions on high seas freedoms.  States use the freedom provided by t he\noc\neans as a conduit for building relationships, strengthening ties and providi ng\nas\nsistance and reassurance to li ke-minded states.   (from Para 2.14)\n•Legal .  The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is  a\nbr\noad-ranging legal framework which defines many of the rights and responsibilities\nof states in the use of the world’s oceans.  UNCLOS divide s the sea into a number of\nzones measured from the baseline, normally the low water line along a nation’scoast, which set s geographical limits in which state authority diminishes.  The picture\nbelow highlights the principal zones and the table summarises the entitlements of\nindividual stat es in these maritime zones : (from Para 2.10)\nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 UNCLOS Sea Zones and Descriptions : \nZone /Area  Description  \nBaseline  Except where otherwise provided in the United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea (UNCLOS), the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the \nterritorial sea is the low -water line along the coast as marked on large- scale \ncharts officially recognised by the coastal state.  \nInternal Waters  Covers all of the waters on the landward side of the baseline. The state is \nresponsible for setting laws and governing their use.  \nTerritorial \nSeas/waters  From the baseline to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles. The state is \nresponsible for setting laws and governing their use, subject to the right of \nvessels from other states exercising the right of innocent, or in international \nstraits, transit passage.  \nContiguous Zone  A zone that may not exceed 24 nautical miles  from the base line,  in which a \nstate can intervene to prevent potential offences which may otherwise occur \ninside territorial waters, or to apprehend a vessel that has committed an offence \ninside territorial waters and is attempting to escape.  \nExclusive \nEconomic Zone \n(EEZ)  This area extends up to 200 nautical miles from the baseline. Within this area a \nstate has sole claim over all natural resources. This includes exploiting \nresources such as oil, gas and fishing. Other states enjoy high seas freedoms in \nthe EEZ, provided these activities do not impact on the coastal state’s rights and \njurisdictions in the EEZ as set out in UNCLOS.  \nContinental Shelf  The continental shelf of a coastal state comprises the seabed and subsoil of the \nsubmarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to \na distance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline.  \nHigh Seas  The high seas are open to all states who may enjoy the freedom of the high seas \nsubject only to the conditions described in UNCLOS/customary law.  Vessels on \nthe high seas are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their flag states, with a \nfew very important exceptions: for example, piracy is a crime of  universal \njurisdiction.  \nFigure 2.1 Illustrating the UNCLOS Sea Zones  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 •Military .  States or other actors may seek to exploit the sea to exert influence upon\nt\nhose they wish to persuade, deter and, if necessary, compel. Equally, maritim e\nf\norces can offer reassurance to allies through a military presence which may also be\na useful lever to help prevent conflict.  Maritime forces can also provide support to\nhumanitarian and disaster relief operations, which has the added benefit of buildi ng\ngl\nobal political relationships and influence.  (from  Para 2.16 ).\nTHE ATTRIBUTES OF MARITIME FORCES  \n2.7. Every military force has distinctive attributes brought about by the characteristics of \nthe environment in which it operates.  Maritime forces have five of these attributes, shown \nbelow.  The purpose of  the attributes  is to generate influence.  Influence is defined as: the \ncapacity to have an effect on the character or behaviour of someone or something, or the \neffect itself. The ability to influence is intrinsically related to the ability to project military \npower.  (from Para 3.15)  \n2.8. Access.  The long-\nstanding principle of freedom of \nnavigation in international waters allows maritime forces to access areas of national interest and potential threat. This access guarantees freedom of navigation for maritime forces up to 12 nautical miles from a \ncoastline to allow options for intervention at a time and place of national choosing.  (Para 3.18)  \n2.9. Poise .  Poise is the ability of \nmaritime forces to loiter in international waters demonstrating a forward military presence at readiness without the political and military complications and risks of deploying forces ashore or projecting from a third- party location. (Para 3.19)  \n2.10.  Mobility .  Exploiting the access and freedom of navigation afforded by the \nsea, provides maritime forces with a high degree of mobility. These rights facilitate maritime manoeuvre and provide a deployable force that can reposition quickly or cover significant dist ances to respond to situations. While shipping lacks the speed \nof aircraft, unless maritime- based aircraft are available to respond, maritime \nplatforms are continuously mobile while having the ability to carry significantly more payload.  This provides huge flexibility at both the tactical and operational levels. (Para 3.20)  \n2.11.  Persistence .  Maritime forces are able to offer a unique persistence providing \na sovereign capability that can be established with minimal political and logistic commitment and easily withdrawn. The endurance provided by on- board stocks, the \nability to replenish at sea and operate at range from host -nation support provides a \nsustained presence unlike that provided by any other military force. However, persistence is tempered by the nature of the environment, the range of engineering spares held on- board and the inability to replenish some weapon systems while at \nsea. (Para 3.21)  \n2.12.  Versatility .  Maritime forces are uniquely versatile, easily changing their \nmilitary posture, while undertaking several tasks concurrently and remaining Influence AcccessPoiseMobility\nPersistance\nVersatillity\nFigure 2.2 The Attributes of Maritime Forces  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 available for rapid re- tasking. Deploying with inherently high levels of readiness, a \nwarship can transition from a peacetime state to a combat ready one in a matter of \nhours.  \nPRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF MARITIME POWER  \n2.13.  The strategic use of maritime power is made possible through the concept of sea \ncontrol and underpinned by the principles of maritime manoeuvre and maritime power \nprojection. These are supported by a number of operational approaches. (Para 3.25)  \n2.14.  Sea Control .  The concept of ‘ sea control’ , is where a maritime force establishes the \nconditions to allow freedom of action in a particular part of the sea, at a particular time, to the required degree and, if necessary, deny its use to an opponent.  Sea control requires control \nof the surface and  subsurface environments (including the seabed), the air above the area in \nwhich sea control is required, the electromagnetic environment and potentially areas of the land where that part of the land dominates the sea. (Para 3.26)  \n2.15.  Levels of Sea Control .  The level of sea control required, and indeed achievable, \nwill depend upon the threat and the mission. Where sea control is not contested the force has achieved it by default and can focus on delivering maritime manoeuvre or maritime \npower projection. I f there is any risk to freedom of action, sea control is necessary; however, \nif the risk is small, the capabilities required can be correspondingly modest. Gaining the necessary level of sea control early, and retaining it, will be a major component of any maritime or expeditionary operation.  (Para 3.27)  \n2.16.  Sea Control Operational Approaches .  Where sea control is necessary it can be \nachieved through one of a number of operational approaches. (from Para 3.28)  \na. Decisive Battle.  While a successful decisive battle at sea, where maritim e\nf\norces classically oppose each other is exceedingly rare in the modern era, a decisiv e\nengagem\nent is not.  A singular act can provide sea control.\nb. Sea Denial .  Sea denial is a form of anti -access and area denial exercised w hen\none par\nty prevents an adversary from controlling a maritime area without being able to\ncontrol that area oneself. It can be a tool for a superior maritime force, either in a\nsecondary area of operations, or for one phase of a larger campaign. Classic means of\nachieving sea denial include laying a minefield or deploying submarines to threat en\nenem\ny surface forces. A more recent method, particularly appropriate in littoral\noperati ons, is to project land assets such as surface- to-surface missile batteries al ong\nt\nhe coast to pose an unacceptable level of risk to maritime units.\nc. Fleet -in-being .  A state deprived of maritime superiority might choose, or  be\nf\norced, to adopt a strategy of fleet -in-being.  By avoiding confrontation with  a superior\nenemy a state can hold back its own maritime forces but continue to threaten those of\nthe enemy or their ability to carry out their mission.\nd. Blockade.  This allows the presence of a stronger maritime power to contai n an\nadv\nersary reluctant to fight, or force a decisive battle on them.\n2.17.  Maritime Manoeuvre.  Sea control and the legal framework which allows \nunrestricted access and presence no closer than 12 nautical miles from the baseline in \npeacetime is a key enabler for maritime manoeuvre.  The ability to operate, particularly in \nlittoral areas, is of cru cial importance, either as the main effort or as the staging area for \ndeploying and sustaining ground forces.  Therefore, as well as the central requirement to be \ncapable of controlling events at sea, maritime power must also be capable of influencing \nevents on land from the sea. (from Para 3.30)  \n2.18.  Maritime Power Projection.  Maritime power projection is the threat, or use, of \nnational power from the sea to influence events. It exploits sea control and maritime \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 manoeuvre to achieve access to threaten or project force ashore using a combination of \namphibious forces, embarked aircraft, land attack weapons, cyber capabilities, electronic \nwarfare and Special Forces.  There are numerous ways in which maritime power pr ojection \ncan contribute to a joint operation.  (from Para 3.33)  \na. Shape.   The sea is, in most cases, a highway free from boundaries and frontiers \nthat provides a valuable arena for joint force manoeuvre.  In preparation for \nsubsequent operations, maritime forces can, for example, be employed to gather \nintelligence and / or mou nt non -combatant evacuation operations.  They may also be \nused to insert special operations forces or to conduct amphibious operations.  \nb. Reassure.   The presence of maritime forces can be used to reassure a friendly \nstate.  A state reassured by the presence of maritime forces is more likely to provide \naccess, basing and overflight.  \nc. Deter .  Maritime forces can be used to deter an aggressor by deploying into a \nregion at an early stage, at relatively low political risk and, if necessary, in considerable strength.  \nd. Coerce.   As maritime forces build up in theatre, they can launch discrete \namounts of mixed land, air, or maritime power against key targets to force an \nadversary away from one course of action or to compel them to take another.  \ne. Disrupt .  Prior to the main offensive, maritime forces can help to shift the \nemphasis from defensive to offensive operations by disrupting enemy activity through \nthe use of amphibious raids  \nf. Project .  An important role of maritime forces, particularly amphibious forces, is \nto provide manoeuvre from the sea.  Speed of manoeuvre at sea will often surprise opponents ashore.  \ng. Support .  The maritime component’s capabilities, in particular its ability to \nengage in precision attack, can support friendly forces ashore or in the air.  Additionally, the sea base may be used to hold a reserve force or serve as a command \nplatform.  \nh. Limit .  Maritime forces can guard the maritime flanks of an operating area and \nby doing so, limit the freedom of manoeuvre of an enemy.  \ni. Recover .  When it comes to withdrawal, maritime forces have the capability to \ntransport large numbers of personnel and equipment out of theatre whilst protecting \nthem in the process.  They may also remain in theatre to provide a strategic reserve.  \nROLES OF MARITIME FORCES \n2.19.  Traditionally  maritime forces have been used by states for a wide variety of tasks. \nThe accepted consensus is that there is a ‘trinity’ of ‘three characteristic modes of action by \nwhich maritime forces operate: namely military, diplomatic and policing functions’.  Thes e \nfunctions have evolved to:  \n• War Fighting.  \n• Maritime S ecuri ty. \n• Defence Engagement . \nIn practice, most operations undertaken by maritime forces will incorporate aspects of each \nof these three roles. They are interrelated and may be conducted concurrently or \nconsecutively with little or no physical change to the force structure. (From Para 4.1)  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 2.20.  Role 1 – War Fighting.  A credible hard power capability provides the foundations \non which the softer roles of maritime security and Defence Engagement are built. Therefore, \nat its core maritime forces must be able to deter potential aggressive acts against the \nsovereign state, and where this fails, conduct successful combat operations in pursuit of the \nnational interest.  In this role maritime forces will generally be configured into a maritime task \ngroup, able to project maritime power through either carrier strike or  littoral manoeuvre, \nwhich provides the capability of projecting a landing force ashore. (Para 4.4)  \n2.21.  Role 2 – Maritime Security .  Maritime security operations  (MSO)  are conducted \nagainst a wide range of activities.  Principally the focus is on the support to trade, including \nfisheries, to safeguard national prosperity.  These are known as Maritime Trade Operations. \nOther activities include: (Para 4.5)  \n•Defence (short of war fighting)  which includes Peace Support Operations (PSO)  and\nt\nhe various forms of Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA) .\n•Humanitarian assistance  and\ndi\nsaster relief  (HADR) .\n•No\nn-combatant evacuati on\noper\nations  (NEO) .\n•Countering piracy, slavery,\npeople smuggling, illegalimmigration, drug smuggling,\narms smuggling, terrorism and\nthe proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction.\n•Freedom of n avigati\non\noper\nations where maritim e\nf\norces exert their rights under\ninternational law to pass\nthrough or exercise i n\nc\nontested waters .\n•Military data gathering may also be \nconsidered a form of MSO as it enables \nmaritime trade operations as well as warfighting. \n2.22.  Role 3 – Defence Engagement .  The versatility and mobility of maritime forces \nprovides a means for political and diplomatic influence in international relations.  Ships’ visits to foreign ports are an important way of projecting soft power globally.   At the MAJCSC , \nstudents are taught that Defence Engagement may be considered in 3 areas:  \n•Conflict prevention to which maritime forces contribute in 2 ways: through deterrence\n,\nbot\nh conventional and nuclear,  and through exercising presence.\n•Post-conflict reconstruction which includes security sector reform (SSR) and capacity\nbuilding.\n•Defence diplomacy which  includes\n–Ship visits  to promote:\nHigh level international engagement (HLIE) and other senior officer visits,\nthe provision of training and education (ie capacity building) and t he\ndepl\noyment of defence attachés.War \nFighting\nDefence \nEngagement\nThe \nuse of \nthe Sea\nMaritime \nSecurity\nFigure 3.3 Roles of Maritime Forces  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 Defence and security exports , for example Defence Security and Investment\nDays (DSID) on board ships, and advising and training foreign personnel i n\nt\nhe use of this equipment.\n–PASSEX (PASSage EXercises) which include most forms of activity conducted at\nsea between warships and auxiliaries of 2 or more nations.\nTHE MARITIME CONTRIBUTION TO MILITARY POWER  \n2.23.

This is a summary of the key ideas and doctrinal elements of JDP 0 -20 Ed 6 Land \nPower  (Oct 2023 ), ADP Land Operations  Parts 1 & 2  (2022 ), ATP -3.2.1  Ed B V1 – Allied Land \nTactics (2018)  and AFM Conventional Warfare  (Jun 22). \n3.2. What is Land Power?  Land power is defined as: “ the ability of land forces to exert \ndecisive control and influence on actors and the course of events.” ( JDP 0 -20 Para 1. 2) \n3.3. Aspects of the Land Environment .  The land environment  is inherently complex and  \nis shaped primarily by the following 3 aspects. (JDP 0 -20 from Para 2.6) \n•Physical aspects .  The land environment  is varied and complex. It includes  open\ngr\nassland, cultivated land, forests, mountains, deserts, jungles, rivers, swamps, urban\nand littoral areas.  Each creates constraints and freedoms, placing different demands\non the people and equipment that operate within them.\n•Human aspects. Within the land environment , people inhabit towns, cities and\nv\nillages, whilst even apparently unpopulated space often contains resources that\nsupport humans in some way. Control over land is consequently of fundamentalpolitical, cultural and psychological importance, and has often  been regarded as\ndecisive in conflict.\n•Information aspects.  The Land environment  is shaped by the way that populations\ninteract; it is the exchange of information between individuals, tribes, ethnic\n and\ni\nnterest groups, and countries that lie at the heart of human dynamics.  This\ncommunication can be verbal, written or visual and it can be conducted directly\nbetween people or through radio, television or online.  Human interaction is expandi ng\nand ac\ncelerating as information flows in the virtual domain increase, linking individuals,\ngroups and societies globally, unconfined by traditional state boundaries.\nUnlike the air or maritime environments , Land  is distinguished by the fact that it is where \npeople predominantly live. It is in the land environment that the roots of conflict are usually \nfound, since conflict on land involves those things that people tend to value most: their lives, \nvalues, property and resources.  \n3.4. The Attribute of Land Forces.   All land forces, regular or irregular, have four inherent \nattributes.  Each attribute has advantages that can be used, but also disadvantages that have to be avoided or mitigated.  (JDP 0 -20 Para1.7 and Ch 3) . \n•Soldiers – Land forces rely on human initiative, enterprise & intelligence.\n•Presence – Land  is where people predominantly live & the roots of conflict are found\n•Persistence –capacity to endur e in an area for long periods of time .\n•Adaptability  – the ability to conduct a wide range of military and non -military tasks.\nLand power is critically dependent on the other operational domains for support. This \ndependency limits the speed and scale of deployment and the degree to which land forces are \nstrategically mobile. This can be offset somewhat by persistent presence and adaptability, but this approach is costly.  \n3.5. The Purpose of Land Forces. (ADP Land Ops 2 from Para 3- 01) “The core purpose \nof land forces is the defeat of opposing land forces in armed conflict ”. \n3.6. The Critical Capability of Land Forces.   (ADP Land Ops 1 from Para 3- 13) “The \ncritical capability of land forces is the ability  to plan and execute combined arms manoeuvre. \nForce and land forces achieve political objectives. The application and threat of force, and the \ngaining and retention of physical objectives, affect political decision- making in ways  \nconsistent with those objectives.  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 3.7. The Three Fundamental Ideas of Land Forces Doctrine  (Core Tenets)  (ADP Land \nOps 2 from Para 2- 01):  Together , the following three concepts  form the fundamental ideas of \nUK land forces’ doctrine: \n•The Manoeuvris t Approach.\n•Mission Command .\n•The Combined Arms Approach.\n3.8. Manoeuvrist Approach – This is covered in Serial 01-02- 01 Joint Doctrine.  \n3.9. Mission Command  - This is covered in Serial 01-02-01 Joint Doctrine.  \n3.10.  Combined Arms Approach.   The combined arms approach is how land forces \norchestrate effects in land tactical operations by combining forces and capabilities, both lethal \nand non- lethal, to overmatch an opponent. It is defined as:  \n“The synchronised and simultaneous application of forces and capabilities across domains to \nachieve an effect greater than if each element was used separately or sequentially ”.  \nThrough task organisation, it reinforces strengths  and compensates for weakness through \ncomplementary grouping. It also imposes  dilemmas on opponents by confronting them with \nmultiple threats; forces are task  organised so that if the opponent attempts to protect against \none threat, they become  vulnerable in another.   It includes the forces and capabilities of all \narmy, joint, and multinational elements across the tactical functions.  \n3.11.  The Tactical Functions.  (Land adapted from the Joint Function Framework ) (ADP \nLand Ops 2 Para 4-07) The tactical functions represent the full breadth of a land force’s \nactivities when conducting operations. They are: \n•Command\n•Intelligence\n•Manoeuvre\n•Fires\n•Information Activities\n•Capacity Building\n•Protection\n•Sustainment \nThe t\nactical functions are a device that helps to organise activities into intelligible groups; they \nhave no effects, whereas the activities do. Few, if any stand alone. All activity needs to be \ncommanded and sustained for example.  The tactical functions also provide a useful checklist \nfor commanders when assessing a plan, and a common vocabulary for describing a force’s \noverall capabilities.  \n3.12.  Land Doctrinal Frameworks.  Frameworks are a tool that allows a commander and \ntheir staff to visualise, organise, integrate, and describe tactical activities in relation to each other in terms of purpose, time, space, and resources.  Land frameworks , but with some small \nchanges,  follow the broad approach of Joint  doctrinal Frameworks  explained in Serial 1 -02-01. \n•Command\n•Intelligence\nActivity to set & \nmaintain the \noperation's \ndirection\n•Manoeuvre\n•Fires\n•Information Activities\n•Capacity Building\nActivity directed at \nthose relevant to \nthe outcome of the \noperation \n(the audience)  \n•Protection\n•Sustainment\nActivity to enable \nthe operation\nFigure 3.1 The Tactical Functions  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Geographic Framework : (ADP Land Ops 2 Para 4-02).\n• Deep.\n• Close.\n• Rear.\n•Operational Framework (ADP Land Ops 2 Para 4-04) (Land adapted from t he\nO\nperations Framework  – ‘supporting’ becomes ‘sustaining’).\n• Shaping – to create or preserve conditions for decisive action.\n• Decisive – to the achievement of the mission.\n• Sustaining – to enable the force to survive, move and fight.\n•Tactical Framework (ADP Land Ops 2 Para 4-05) (Land adapted from the Functional\nFramework  – name difference only ).\n• Find.\n• Fix.\n• Strike .\n• E\nxploit.\n3.13.  Types of Operation.  Each land tactical operation (See Serial 1 -01-03 for  Campaign \nThemes &  Types of Operation) will consist of a tailored combination of offensive, defensive, \nenabling and stability tactical activities, each of which should be viewed as the building blocks \nof any land tactical operation. The exact combination will be determined by the mission and \nthe commander’s intent. Each tactical activity has a specific aim.  Operations will typically \ncomprise a sequence of tactical activities, for example:  \n•Combat  operations : Reconnaissance, march, obstacle crossing, attack, pursuit or\ntransition to defence.\n\nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024  \n3.14.  Tactical Activities.  (AFM Conventional Warfare from Para 1- 12). Tactical activities \nare grouped by common purpose in four categories : Each type of tactical activit y has \nparticular characteristics and principles. Activities are tangible undertakings that can be \nassigned to units and sub- units, usually through specific tactical tasks such as block, \nseize, etc (see Serial  3-04-03). The table below should not be considered all -inclusive, for \nunique activities and tasks may exist or be developed that are not indicated but that will still fit within one of these four categories. Note also that a large tactical action may include \ndifferent activities. For example, an attack m ay be enabled by the deployment of a screen \n(security). The key here is for commanders to understand that they are responsible for this whole range of tactical activit y at any given time.

The aim of offensive operations is to defeat the enemy and/or \nseize key terrain objectives .  Offensive  tactical activities are described as activities, in which \nforces seek out the enemy to attack the enemy and degrade, destroy, neutralise or otherwise Figure 3.2 Illustrative example of balance of tactical activity plotted against  campaign themes and use of force.  \nFigure 3.3 Tactical Activities ( AFM Conventional & Unconventional Warfare) . \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 affect its capabilities. In addition, they may also focus on seizing or securing terrain objectives \nsuch as vital ground.    \n•Attack.  There are four types of attacks: hasty, deliberate, counter -attack and spoiling.\n•Exploitation .  Is defined as taking full advantage of success in battle and followi ng up\nin\nitial gains.\n•Pursuit .  Pursuit is specifically designed to cut off an enemy force attempting to\nescape, with the aim of defeating it.\n•Raid .  This is defined as an operation, usually small- scale, involving a swift penetrati on\nof\n hostile territory to secure information, confuse the enemy, or destroy their\ninstallations.\n•Ambush .  Is defined as a surprise attack by fire from concealed positions on a movi ng\nor\n temporarily halted enemy .\n•Breakout .  In a breakout activity, an encircled force attempts to link up with other\nfriendly forces .\n3.16.  Defensive Activities.  The aim of d efensive activities is  to: hold vital ground or key \nterrain,  halt an enemy advance, to buy time, or to generate opportunities for offensive action. \nBy holding key terrain or fixing the enemy in one area, the conditions for successful offensive action can be created. The object is to force the enemy into action that narrows their options, \nreduces fighting power and makes them vulnerable to a counter -attack. The challenge is to \nseize the initiative from the attacker. The defender should lure the attacker into situations where they are vulnerable, can be surprised, and fix for defeat by counterattack.   \n•Mobile Defence.  Mobile defence is used to defeat an attack by focusing on theadversary’s forces, rather than seeking to hold ground.\n•Area defence .  Area defence is used to defeat an attack by denial of ground thr\nough\nt\nhe concentration of forces and counter -mobility effects, for example, using obstacles\nor field defences.  A rule of thumb is that a well -prepared defence can defeat or block\nan enemy with a 3:1 advantage.\n•Delay. Delaying activities are those in which a force being pressed by an attackingadversary trades space for time, reducing the adversary’s momentum and inflicti\nng\ndam\nage without itself becoming decisively committed .\n3.17.  Stability Activities .  Stability activities are bespoke tactical methods used for \ndelivering the stabilisation aspect of any land operation. They require a full spectrum  \ncomprehensive approach with host nation and allied agencies.   \n3.18.  Enabling Activities.  Enabling activities link other tactical activities together. They \ninclude those intended to make or break contact with an enemy, and those conducted out of \ncontact. An enabling activity links two tactical activities and is never conducted for its own \nsake.   Successful execution requires the same level of planning and training as that required \nfor offensive, defensive or stability activities. Enabling activities are:  \n•Reconnaissance.   To obtain information about, and understanding of, the human,\ninformation and physical aspects of the land operating environment.  Reconnaissanc e\nc\nan be done by stealth  or using reconnaissance in  force .\n•Security .  To provide early and accurate warning of enemy dispositions and actions to\nprotect and enable the force.\n•The March .  To move a force efficiently to its place of tactical employment.\n•Advance to contact .  To gain or regain contact with an enemy under the most\nfavourable conditions. It is normally executed in preparation for subsequent offensiv e\na\nctivity.\n•Meeting Engagement .  To gain (or regain) the initiative through combat action that\noccurs when a moving force, engages an enemy at an unexpected time and place.\n•Demonstration & Feint .\nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Crossing & breaching of Obstacles.  To project combat power across an obstacle\nwhile ensuring the maintenance of momentum and initiative.\n•Link- up.  To join two or more forces in contested territory\n•Relief of troops.   These are  so that one force can take over the actions or activities\nfrom another. There are several  types :\noRelief in P lace (RIP) .  Occurs when all or part of a force is replaced in  an\noper\nating area by an incoming unit, e.g.,  when rotating forces in area defence.\noForward passage of lines (FPOL) .  Occurs when one force moves forwar d\nt\nhrough another towards the enemy.\noRearward passage of lines (RPOL) .  Occurs when a force moving, usually\nfrom contact, passes through another unit in defence.\n•Withdrawal . (Disengage the force from physical contact with an enemy)\n•Retirement . (Movement  away from and out of contact with an enemy)\n3.19.  Forms of Manoeuvre  (In Attack) .  (AFM Conventional Warfare from Para 2-09) To \nmanoeuvre is to gain a position of advantage relative to the enemy.  During the planning \nprocess, a commander will determine what form of manoeuvre to use in order to position forces where they can achieve an advantage. The attack may be directed against the front, \nflank or rear of the enemy and may be conducted from the ground, air, sea or a combination of \nthese.   There are five basic forms of manoeuvre . \n•Turning movement . A turning movement is a variation of the envelopment in whic\nh\nt\nhe attacking force passes around or over the enemy’s principal defensive positions to\nsecure objectives deep in the enemy’s rear, force the enemy to abandon their positi on\nor\n divert major forces to meet the threat.\n•Envelopment . An envelopment is NATO defined as an offensive manoeuvre where\nthe main attacking force passes around or over the enemy’s principal defensiv e\npos\nitions to secure objectives to the enemy’s rear. It is designed to apply force against\nan enemy vulnerability , but will normally require a diversionary or fixing attack to\ndistract the enemy.\nFigure 3.4 Turning Movement  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Double envelopment .  A double envelopment is an envelopment operation mount ed\non\n two axes that is designed to outflank an enemy from both sides with a view t o\nf\norcing them to abandon their positions, or as a prelude to encirclement and defeat of\nthe trapped forces. It may be also complemented by a diversionary or fixing attack\nagainst  one of their positions.\n•Frontal attack. A frontal attack is an offensive manoeuvre in which the main action is\ndirected against the front of the enemy forces. It will be commonly employed to fix theenemy in position, usually as a precursor for a turning movement or envelopment. A\nfrontal attack could generate surprise and success if another pattern of activity (such\nas attacking the flanks) has been previously established. Usually however, the frontalattack is the least desirable form of manoeuvre as it is typically the approach that t\nhe\nenem\ny is expecting. It should only be considered:\noAgainst a weak or disorganised enemy.\nFigure 3.5 Envelopment  \nFigure 3.6 Double Envelopment  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 oWhen the attacker has overwhelming combat power.\noWhen the time and situation require immediate action.\noWhen the mission is to fix the enemy in position or deceive the enemy\n•Penetration. A penetration is NATO defined as a form of offensive action that seeks  to\nbr\neak through the enemy’s defence and disrupt the defensive system. Infiltration is\npenetration by stealth. Penetration seeks to reach the depths of an enemy’s position\non one or a number of narrow axes. Penetration may be necessary to achieve any of\nthe other forms of manoeuvre. There are three types of penetration (deep, multiple\npenetrations, or a combination of both) and all may be combined in the sam e\noper\nation.\n3.20. Reserves and echelon forces.  A land force commander  must have \nuncommitted forces at his dis posal to maintain flexibility in order to: \n•Maintain momentum and the initiative.\nFigure 3.7 Frontal Attack  \nFigure 3.8 Penetration  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Exploit opportunities .\n•React on enemy’s course of action.\n3.21. Echelon forces are those with a pre-p lanned specific mission, but are yet to be \ncommitted, often kept in depth. They are committed onto their planned tasks to sustain the \nmomentum of an oper ation. \n3.22. Reserves are unc ommitted forces and assets , that are held on standby at t he \ncommander's disposal. Reserves  are employed to force the decision, t o fac ilitate a shift of the \nmain effort or to ov ercome critical situations. They can be key to success, especially in \ncombat. The initiative can often be retained or gained only by their employment. Reserves \nare the most important a nd often the last means a c ommander has available to react to \nunforeseen developments or decisively influence the c ourse of an operation. A reserve must \nbe established for all oper ations  and activities at battalion level and above.\n3.23. Brigade Tactical Check Notes.  The following ex tracts from AFM Part 3 are enclosed:  \n•Attack: •Stability Activities\n•Attack: Exploitation & Pursuit •Advance  to Contact\n•Delay •Forward Passage of Lines\n•Area Defence •Relief in Place\n•Mobile Defence •Rearward Passage of Lines\nCheck Notes – Attack  \n•Attack.  An attack comprises a sequence of assaults, supported by suppressive fire\nuntil the objective is secured. The attack must concentrate forces against the enemy’s\nidentified weaknesses and be conducted in such a way that it is possible to neutralis e\nenem\ny counter -attacks. The momentum of the attack should be continuous without any\nsignificant pause to maintain pressure on the enemy and force them to be reactive.\nFigure 3.9 Execution of Attack  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 10 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Purpose  \nThe purpos e of an attac k is to destroy the enemy ’s capabilit y to fight and subsequentl y to \ndestr oy the enemy ’s will and cohesion. There are four types of attack:  \n• Deliberate : To defeat  a well-prepared enem y. The emphasi s is on preparation  at the expens e of spee d \nand time,  therefore  methods  other  than speed  will be required in order to achiev e surprise.  \n• hasty : Seek s to take advantage  of the enemy ’s lack of preparedness , and involve s boldness , surpris e, \nand speed  in order to achiev e success  before  the enem y has had time to balanc e the force. \n• Spoiling : To disrup t a hostil e attac k while the enem y is in the proces s of formin g up or assembling  \nfor an attack.  \n• Counter : To regain lost ground , isolat e or destroy enem y force elements .

It is characterised by a rapid advance against lessening resistance and its effects are both \nphysical and psychological.    \nThe purpose of a pursuit . The pursuit seeks to catch or cut off an enemy who fears envelopment \nand who is demoralised and beginning to disintegrate under pressure.  \nPrinciples  \n• Maintain the initiative  \n• Exploit manoeuvre  • Balance  \nGroupings  \nExploitation  \n• Exploitation force  \n• Security force Reserve  Pursuit  \n• Pursuing force  \n• Blocking force  \n• Security force  \n• Reserve  \nSequence  \nExploitation  \n• Maintain pressure . The exploitation \nforce maintains contact with the \nenemy on a broad front, preventing \nforces from reorganising for defence, \nconducting counter -attacks or \nwithdrawing effectively.  \n• Transition to pursuit . As pressure \non the enemy intensifies and they \nbegin to disintegrate, the \ncommander may order the transition to a pursuit  Pursuit  \n• Maintain pressure . The pursuing force conducts attacks \non the enemy to force the enemy to turn and fight to \nenable the blocking force to manoeuvre into position.  \n• Manoeuvre and block. The blocking force advances \nalong parallel routes (ground and/or air) to the enemy’s \nline of retreat. The blocking force may also attack the flank \nof a retreating enemy if it cannot manoeuvre behind it.  \n• Destroy or capture . The enemy is destroyed or captured \non the blocking positions as the blocking force and \npursuing force link up.  \n• Ceasing the pursuit. The pursuit may end when the \nfollowing criteria have been met; the destruction of the enemy, a successful enemy counter -\nattack, on orders from \nthe divisional commander or when the pursing force has \nculminated due to lack of combat power,  but this must be \nin consultation with the divisional commander  \nExploit & Pursuit  Planning Considerations by Tactical Function  \nCommand  \n• Identify CCIRs to trigger decision to \nexploit/pursue in coordination with the \ndivision  \n• Identify DP when exploitation develops into \npursuit  \n• Centralised control, decentralised execution \n• Dynamic FSCM and BM \n• Use of RRB, alternate and tactical CPs to \nmaintain communication over extended \ndistances  \n• Echelon force to prevent culmination  \n• Designation of bypass policy  \n• Requirement to conduct an FPOL with a \nfresh pursuing force from the division or \nechelon forces within the brigade Intelligence  \n• Triggers for exploitation:  \no Increase in enemy CPERS  \no Increase in abandoned enemy equipment and \nmaterial  \no Overrunning of enemy Arty, C2 facilities, log \nsites  \no Significant decrease in enemy resistance or in \norganised fires and manoeuvre  \no Mixture of support and combat vehicles in \nformations and columns  \no Increase in enemy movement rearward  \n• Allocation of divisional ISR to the brigade to ‘find’ \nin depth \n• Maintenance of COP and fusion of intelligence \nfrom battlegroups and division  \n• Air threat  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 15 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Exploit & Pursuit  Continued:  \nManoeuvre  \n• Maintain pressure on the enemy  \n• Reconstitution of an echelon  \n• Use of AM forces to establish blocking \npositions  \n• Allocation of mobility support assets to lead \nbattlegroups  \n• Echelon forces to destroy bypassed enemy  Fires  \n• Targeting priorities:  \no Enemy reserves  \no Withdrawing columns  \no Choke points  \no Flanks  \n• Movement of fires assets to support pursuing force \n(mortars and divisional artillery if assigned)  \n• Use of aviation  \nInformation  \n• Use of IA to maximise impact of a successful \npursuit  Protection  \n• Security of extended LOC and associated risk  \n• Plan to deal with bypassed enemy  \n• Security of flanks  \n• Limited AD coverage  \n• CID to prevent fratricide  \nSustainment  \n• Anticipate exploitation and consequent increase in distance, demand and duration of operation \nover extended lines of communication  \nHealth Service Support  \n• Robust MEDEVAC plan and possible movement of MTF forward.

The pursuing force maintains pressure on the retreating enemy.  \n2. If possible, a blocking force is inserted into the enemy’s rear by encirclement or air manoeuvre.  \n3. Engagement of enemy  inside a killing area will complete destruction of en emy force. This will require  \nBattlespace Management  (BM) and F ire Support Coordination Measures  (FSCM).  \n4. Security forces will be req uired to guard vulnerable flanks.  \n5. Balance & culmination must be monitored. The Bde must be prep to halt and allow FPOL to allow echelon \nto continue pursuit . \nFigure 4.6 Exploit & Pursuit  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 16 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Check Notes –  Delay  \nPurpose  \nThe purpos e of delayin g operation s are those in which a force being  presse d by an attacking  adversar y \ntrades  space  for time requirin g the most mobil e forces for the terrai n and a high standard  of collectiv e \nperformanc e in manoeuv re and comman d and control. A delay  is conducted  to avoid battle in \nunfavourabl e conditions , to slow an enemy ’s   advance,  to inflict damage,  to gathe r informatio n without  \ngiving informatio n away, and withou t itself becoming decisivel y engaged .

The delaying force fights the delay battle from successive or alternate positions.  \n4. Offensive action should be conducted wherever possible including local counter attacks against fleeting \nopportunities or planned strikes against depth targets using assets such as AH.  \n5.

It maybe required to impose delay on a \nflanking enemy.  \n4. AM forces from the division maybe deployed ahead of the reconnaissance force to seize key \nterrain.  \nThe advance to C ontact : \n1. Reconnaissance force identifies enemy positions and communicates them to the commander.  \n2. Elements of the advance guard fix larger enemy positions for destruction by the main body.  \n3. The commander monitors the progress of forces in contact and commits forces from the main \nbody as required.  \n4. Enemy positions are normally destroyed as they are identified, a bypass policy will need to be \narticulated.  \nTransition : \n1. The commander may need to transition the force to another activity prior to transitioning back \nto the advance and will likely be informed by the enemy.  \n \n \nFigure 4.10 Advance and Advance to Contact  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 30 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Check Notes – Forward Passage of Lines (FPOL)  \nPurpose  \nThe purpos e of an F POL is to enabl e a force to advanc e or attac k through another force.

This summary is taken from JDP 0- 30 UK Air Power  3rd Ed (2022) and AP3002 Air \nWarfare 5th Ed (Sep 2023). \n4.2. What is Air Power ? The fundamental purpose of military air power is achieving \nmastery of the  air.  Air power is  defined as: “ the ability to use air capabilities in and from the \nair, to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events .” (JDP 0 -30 Para 1. 2) \n4.3. Fundamental Characteristics of  Air Power . (JDP 0 -30 from Para 1.4) \n•Height –enables aviators to observe, and deliver, activities in the land and maritime\nenvironments .\n•Speed – enables the rapid and responsive projection of power .\n•Reach – enables adversaries to be influenced, regardless of their location.\nWhile height, speed and reach represent core air power characteristics in their own right, \nthey act together synergistically to produce additional characteristics:  \n•Agility – a blend of responsiveness, adaptability, flexibility and resilience using multi-\nrole & multi- mission capabilities .\n•Ubiquity  – Height, speed and reach, combined with the agility of air  capabilities,\nprovide air power with ubiquity .\n•Concentration - concentrate military force in time and space, when and where it is\nrequired.\n4.4. The Air Environment .  The air environment is an unforgiving one and, thus, aircraft \nare designed to meet the challenges of operating at a variety of altitudes, temperature extremes and speed ranges . \n4.5. Limitations of Air Power . (JDP 0 -30 from Para 1.10 ) \n•Impermanence.  Aircraft cannot yet stay airborne indefinitely. Although the use of\nair-to-air refuelling can extend the range and endurance of aircraft.\n•Limited payload . The payloads that can be carried by aircraft are limited i\nn\nc\nomparison with ships or land vehicles .\n•Fragility . Structurally, aircraft are highly stressed and built to be as light as\npracticable, carrying little or no armour protection; thus, relatively low levels  of battl e\ndam\nage may have a catastrophic effect .\n•Cost .  Many military aircraft use cutting- edge technology, which, inevitably, comes at\nsignificant financial cost .\n•Basing and overflight .  All forms of military power depend on basing, support  and\npr\notection; aircraft are no exception .\n•Weather .  Poor weather may still create some difficulties, but modern technology means\nthat the majority of military aircraft can now operate in all light conditions, day and night,\nregardless of weather conditions .\n4.\n6. Manned / Crewed Aircraft .  Crewed  combat aircraft are categorised according to \ntheir ‘generation’ which broadly reflects their capabilities. A generational shift in combat \naircraft occurs when a technological innovation cannot be incorporated into an existing \naircraft through upgrade. Although there are currently five broadly accepted generations, \nmost NATO air forces are equipped with fourth and fifth generation aircraft.  \n•Third Generation .  Third generation aircraft form the bulk of most non- western air\nforces, originally entering service during the 1970s and 1980s.  These were multi -role\nai\nrcraft  capable of supersonic flight and engaging targets beyond visual range.  This\ngeneration includes the Mig- 27 Flogger and Mirage III.\n•Fourth Generation .  Fourth generation aircraft are those designed to bridge the  gap\nbet\nween the developments of the 1970s and those entering service after 2000.\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Typically, aircraft from this generation employed fly -by-wire systems and digital \nprocessing for enhanced on- board sensors  and the ability to employ precision \nweaponry. This generation includes the Typhoon, F -15 Eagle, Mig- 29 Fulcrum and \nSu-27 Flanker.  \n• Fifth Generation .  Fifth generation aircraft combine new developments such as \ncomposite materials, low observable technology, advanced electronically scanned \nradars and sensor fusion to greatly improve pilot situational awareness. This \ngeneration includes  aircraft such as the B -2 Spirit; F -22 and F- 35. \n4.7. Unmanned Aircraft .  An unmanned  aircraft is an aircraft that does not carry a \nhuman operator and is operated remotely using varying levels of automated functions. Unmanned aircraft can be expendable or recoverable, they may carry a lethal or non- lethal \npayload.  Cruise missiles are not considered unmanned aircraft.   Due to the lack of a \nrequirement to accommodate a human being, unmanned aircraft can be significantly smaller \nthan manned aircraft, thus the range of sizes can be greater than that of manned a ircraft. \nUnmanned aircraft are  categorised as follows:  \n• Class One (Less than 150kg) - includes three sub classifications -  Micro, Mini and \nSmall, all generally used at tactical level.  \n• Class Two (150 -  600kg) . \n• Class Three (600kg+) . \n \nFigure 4.1 NATO UAS  Classification  \nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 3 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 4.8. Fundamental Air Power Roles .  \nThe f our fundamental air power roles are: \n• Control of the Air  (Counter Air).  \n• Attack.  \n• Intelligence, Surveillance & \nReconnaissance.  \n• Air Mobility . \nThese four roles can be conducted in \nisolation, combined or, more usually, as \npart of multi -domain operations within a \ncomprehensive approach, these roles \ncontribute to persistent influence and \ndeterrence activities as well as to the \ndirect task assigned.  \n4.9. Airpower  Enablers:  the ability to \ndeliver each of the four air power roles is \ndependent on critical enablers: base; \nsustain; C4I connect; and protect . (JDP 0 -30 Ch 4.) \nCONTROL OF THE AIR - Secures our joint freedom of manoeuvre.  \n4.10.  Terminology. Operationally, control of the air is achieved via \ncounter -air operations; a term that is also used by NATO and the United \nStates Air Force to describe the over -arching air power role.  \n4.11.  Control of the Air Definition : “freedom, over a given period of \ntime, to use a volume of airspace for our own purposes while, if necessary, denying or \nconstraining its use by an opponent” .  (AP3002 Para  501). \n4.12.  Purpose:   Control of the air is the most important air power role because it secures  \nour joint freedom of manoeuvre.  At the operational level, it assures military freedom of \nmanoeuvre in the air, land or maritime domains. This allows our commanders to seize the \ninitiative while denying it to an adversary.  The breakdown of control of the air is depicted in \nFigure 5.2 below.   \n4.13.  Degrees of Control of the Air :  NATO recognises three  levels of control:   \n• Air parity . Air parity exists where no force enjoys decisive control of the air in either \ntime or space. Consequently, both friendly and adversary land, maritime and air \nforces may encounter significant interference by the opposing force.  \n• Air Superiority : That degree of dominance in the air battle of one force over another, \nwhich permits the conduct of operations by the former, and its related maritime, land \nand air forces at a given time and place, without prohibitive interference by the \nopposing force.   \n• Air Supremacy:  The degree of air superiority where the opposing air force is \nincapable of effective interference.  It is important to note that even air supremacy \ncannot guarantee that an adversary will not inflict some damage or losses, \nparticularly given the extensive proliferation of small arms weapons and man-\nportable air defences. This is normally the highest level of control of the air that a \njoint force can achieve. (JDP 0 -30 Para 2.3 a, b & c). \n \nFigure 4.2 The Roles of Air Power  \n\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 4.14.  Executing Control \nof the Air .  Control of the \nair is not a permanent state \nand constant activity is \nrequired to achieve it. To \ngain and maintain the required degree of control \nof the air, counter -air \noperations are conducted to disrupt, degrade, deny or \ndestroy an adversary’s ability to challenge such \ncontrol. Counter -air \noperations comprise two key missions: offensive \ncounter -air (OCA) and Air & \nMissile Defence  (AMD) \nwhich is also known as defensive counter -air \n(DCA).  (JDP 0 -30 Para 2. 4) \n4.15.  Airspace Control :  \nThe goal of airspace control is to increase combat effectiveness of all \ncomponents by promoting \nthe safe, efficient and \nflexible use of airspace \nthrough the Airspace Control Plan.  \n4.16.  Counter Air \nOperations - Offensive \nversus Defensive Counter -\nAir Balance: \n•Offensive is proactive, defensive is responsive .\n•Preferred approach is to use offensive counter air operations to destroy or disruptenemy before they launch aircraft or missiles\n.\n4.\n17. Offensive Counter Air (OCA) .  (AP3002 from Para 514) \n•Surface attack .  OCA surface attack operations target an adversary’s air and missil e\nc\napabilities on the ground and their supporting military infrastructure. They employ\nair-to-surface and surface- to-surface fires and may also employ capabilities i n\nc\nyberspace when authorized. Surface attacks are frequently employed as the initial\nmissions within an overall counter -air campaign . Typical targets include the following:\noAirfields .\noAircraft .\noOperating Surfaces .\noC2 Faci lities.\noPower\noAirfield Defenc es.\noSurface based early warning syste ms.\noC2.\noTheatre Ballistic Missiles.\nFigure 4.3 The Hierarchy of \nControl of the Air Activities  \nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Fi\nghter Escort High Value Asset Attack .\noFighter  Sweep .  Utilising AD- capable aircraft to sweep through a designat ed\nar\nea of enemy airspace to sanitize the airspace of any air -to-air threat . There\nar\ne two types:\nArea Sweep\nRoute Sweep\noFighter Escort .  Protection mission to protect vulnerable aircraft packages .\nThe escor t can be detached from the aircraft package, embedded or clos e\nand i\nncluded HVAA (High Value Air Asset) protection.   There are three types:\nDetached Escort .\nClose Escort .\nOrganic Escort .\n•Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) .  As part of counter -air operations,\nSEAD missions are carried out to protect friendly aircraft from the threat posed by an\nadversary’s surface - based AD (SBAD) systems; primarily SAMs. These systems\nmay be part of an elaborate and well- integrated AD organisation (typically referred to\nas an integrated AD system (IADS)) . There are two approaches  to suppression.\noDestruction.  Kinetic d estruction of an adversary’s IADS or its components is\npreferable to temporarily suppressing it; it removes a threat and reduces sorti e\nr\nequirements, frees crews and aircraft whilst increasing the safety factor of\nfuture attack missions.\noDisruption.  Disruption in the form of electronic/cyber denial, degradation,\ndeception, delay or  neutralisation of an adversary’s AD systems can\ntemporarily increase aircraft  survivability; however, the effects will usually  be\nof\n a limited duration.\noCategories of SEAD Operations :\nArea Suppression.\nLocalised Suppression.\nOpportune Suppression.\n•High -value Airborne Asset Attack (HVAAA) .  HVAAA uses air -to-air capabl e\nai\nrcraft to attack an adversary’s critical airborne assets such as AEW, AWACS, AAR\nor electronic warfare (EW) aircraft, to either destroy them or force them to retrogr ade\n(\nmove from their operational location, thereby reducing their effectiveness) .\n4.18.  Air and Missile Defence Operations (AMD)  also known as Defensive Counter -\nAir (DCA) .  At the operational -level and tactical level, DCA & AMD are effectively \nindistinguishable,  and the terms may be used inter -changeably.  AMD consists of all active \nand passive operations to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy or negate adversary air and missile forces attempting to attack or penetrate friendly battlespace, or to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of such attacks should attackers escape destruction. The Air & M issile \nDefence Commander  is responsible for the  integration of all air defence  efforts regardless of \nsystem ownership . primarily carried out over friendly territory and, unlike OCA, may take \nplace at any point on the spectrum of conflict; from early warning and air policing in peacetime through to inflicting maximum attrition on an adversary’s attacking air and missile forces during combat operations. (AP3002 Para 521). \n•Active AMD . This  involves any direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify or\nreduce the effectiveness of adversary air and missile attack against friendly forces\nand critical elements. It is achieved through integrated detection, identification,\nassessment, interception and engagement and usually characterised by layer\ned\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 6 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 defence- in-depth affording multiple engagement opportunities, utilising reactive air -\nto-air capable fighters, SAMs and other assets placed on airborne or ground alert . \n• Passive AMD .  This  includes all other measures taken to minimise the effectiveness \nof hostile air and missile attacks. Elements of passive AMD include: detection and \nearly warning; camouflage, concealment and deception; hardening, dispersal and \nrecuperation; redundancy; mobility; and chemical biological radiological and nuclear \n(CBRN) preparations.  \nATTACK-  which can coerce and influence actors into changing or  \nmaintaining behaviour.  (AP3002 from Para 601). \n4.19.  Purpose:  Air attack lies at the heart of air power’s capacity to \ncreate influence by changing behaviours  or the course of events. It is a \ncoercive activity as it creates tactical, operational and strategic effects through the threat, and use, of force.   \n4.20.  Strategic attack . To conduct actions to achieve coercive or decisive effects by \ndisrupting an adversary’s strategic ability or will to carry out aggressive activity and other \nundesirable actions.   It is achieved through the disruption or destruction of an adversary’s \ncentre(s) of gravity, or other vital target sets.  \n4.21.  Counter -Land .  Air operations is to gain and maintain a desired degree of control of \nthe battlefield by targeting fielded adversary ground forces and the infrastructure directly \nsupporting them.  It comprises:  \n• Air Interdiction (AI) .  Actions taken to destroy, disrupt, divert or delay the \nadversary’s surface forces before they can be used effectively against friendly forces. \nAI is carried out at such distance from friendly forces that detailed integration of each \nair mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces is not required.  Either:  \no Pre-planned, or  \no Immediate (Armed recce, airborne alert , Kill box interdiction  & SCAR )  \n \n• Close Air Support  (CAS) .  Action by fixed- wing and rotary -wing aircraft against \nadversary forces in close proximity to friendly forces, and thus requires detailed \nintegration of each air mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces for \nfratricide avoidance and targeting guidance.  Either:  \no Pre-planned (scheduled & on- call). \no Immediate  CAS. \no Push  CAS. \nFigure 4.4 The Range \nof Air Attack Activities  \n\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 o Emergency CAS. \n• CAS versus AI. \no Where in the battlespace:  \n CAS usually occurs between the FLOT and the FSCL; AI occurs beyond \nthe FSCL  \no The degree of coordination required:  \n The degree of coordination required for CAS is greater due to the close \nproximity of the target to friendly forces. The coordination required refers \nto the detailed integration with the fire and movement of other forces.   \n As AI is conducted beyond the FSCL, detailed integration with friendly forces is not required.  \no Realisation of effects:   \n AI effects can take days or even weeks to be perceived, whilst CAS effects are felt almost immediately . \no Risk and Return : \n Generally speaking CAS targets tend to be high risk, (due to their position \nin the battlespace and their proximity to adversary forces) low return (single tanks or APCs) but are often high priority particularly for the troops on the ground   \no Efficient use of Air :  \n CAS is a less efficient use of joint air power than AI as the returns are generally lower than those undertaking AI.   \n \n4.22.  Counter -maritime .  Uses air power to extend the application of air attack into the \nhigh seas, or the littoral and its adjacent waters. Such operations range from strategic attack \nto AI and CAS, through to specific maritime- orientated underwater warfare and surface \nwarfare:  \n• Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) .  Air operations to search for, locate, classify, track \nand attack submarines and their support assets, at sea or in port, to deny the \nadversary  the effective use of submarines.  \n• Surface Warfare (ASuW) .  Air operations to ensure the detection and engagement \nof enemy naval surface forces and merchant ships to deny their effectives employment.   Aircraft may be used for  the detection, location, identification, \nrecognition, reporting and engagement of surface vessels.  \nINTELLIGENCE , SURVEILLANCE  & RECONNAISSANCE (ISR) . \nInforms the development of understanding across all domains.   \n(AP3002 from Para 701)  \n4.23.  Purpose:  The intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance \n(ISR) process is a framework through which a single collection requirement is satisfied by an \nISR asset and employs the 4- step intelligence cycle: direction; collection; processing  and \ndissemination (DCPD). These steps apply at all levels of command, across components, for \nany type of mission and in all operational environments. While ISR activities are not unique \nto air and space operations, the fundamental attributes of air and space power make aircraft \nand satellites ideally suited to the ISR collect role. .   \n• ISR is focused implicitly, rather than explicitly, on decision- making.  \n•  ISTAR can be thought of as applied ISR. It uses the output from the ISR process to \nsupport tactical level activity, specifically targeting and the creation of effects .   \nThe Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance  role consists of 3 linked inform functions :  \n\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 8 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 4.24.  Intelligence (different from information) .  Intelligence is the product resulting from the \ndirected collection and processing of information regarding the environment and the \ncapabilities and intentions of actors, in order to identify threats and offer opportunities for \nexploitation by decision- makers.  It consists of the five TCPED steps  shown in Fig 4 .5. \n4.25.  Surveillance (routine observation) .  Continuing and systematic observation.   Not \norientated towards specific target but provides warnings and detects changes.  \n4.26.  Reconnaissance (targeted activity) .  Compliments surveillance through visual \nobservation or other detection methods to obtain specific information about activities and resources.  \n4.27.  Traditional Reconnaissance (ISR/IST AR) This is delivered by dedicated large ISR \nair platforms  designed and operated for this specific purpose , often with multiple crew \nmembers  conducting analysis . Examples include:  \n• E-3D Sentry. Long \nrange conventional \nradar alongside \nprovision of  airborne \nC2. \n• RC-135 Rivet Joint. \nSIGINT.  \n• Shadow R1. EO/IR.  \n• Islander and \nDefender. EO/IR.  \n• MQ-9 Reaper. \nEO/IR plus synthetic \naperture radar and GMTI  (as well as a \nprecision attack \ncapability).  \n• P-8A Poseidon. \nAcoustic \nintelligence, EO/IR, \nISR, EW support \nmeasures  (+ search \nand rescue ). \n4.28.  Non-traditional \nReconnaissance \n(ISR/IST AR) is delivered by \ncombat air platforms with purpose -built pods fitted with imagery intelligence (IMMINT) and \nother sensors.   Examples include:  \n• Multirole aircraft  – F35 Lightning / Typhoon . \n• Attack Helicopters –  AH-64 Apache / AH-1Z Viper . \n• ISR - focused implicitly, rather than explicitly, on decision -making.  Utility of the \ndefinition lies fundamentally at the strategic and operational levels  and predominates \nwithin joint and air doctrine. The correct application and fusing of ISR products can \nprovide information advantage which, in turn,  can identify opportunities within the full -\nspectrum targeting process.  \n• ISTAR  - can be thought of as applied ISR. It uses the output from the ISR  process to \nsupport tactical level activity, specifically targeting and the creation  of effects. Utility of \nthe definition lies very much at the tactical level and permeates British Army doctrine. In \nFigure 4.5 The \nHierarchy of Joint Air \nMobility Activities  \nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 addition, aircraft such as the MQ -9 Reaper  have blurred the distinctions between ISR \nassets and attack assets.  \nAIR MOBILITY . Provides the ability to deploy, sustain and recover \npersonnel and equipment, often over significant distance.  \n(AP3002 from Para 801) \n4.29.  Purpose:  Air mobility provides the ability to deploy, sustain and \nrecover personnel and equipment, often over significant distance.  Air \nmobility operations are generally classified as inter - or intra- theatre,  and both may be \nconducted simultaneously .  The Air Mobility role uses the following activities:   \n4.30.  Airlift .  Airlift is the ability to transport personnel, equipment and materiel through the \nair.  It has a number of employment options:  \n•Hub and Spoke.   Aircraft fly into a central point (hub) and then distributed in theatre\nalong ‘spokes’.    Integrates  inter and intra theatre airlift.\noInter -theatre .  Provides air -bridge that links theatres or JOAs to the\nhomeland or to other theatres.   Provided by heavy strategic air transport.\nSupplemented by chartered airlift.   Augmented by tactical range air transport.\noIntra -theatre .  Provides air movement within a specific theatre  or JOA.\nFulfilled by tactical fixed wing aircraft or rotary wing support helicopters.\nInvolves operations in tactical conditions, including small. Austere and\nunimproved field operations.\n•Aeromedical Evacuation.Uses air assets to transportinjured personnel, under\nmedical supervision, t\no\nm\nedical facilities.\n•Airborne Operations.\nTransports airborne combat\nforces directly onto, or near\ntheir objectiv e and\ns\nubsequently sustain or\nextricate them.

Personnel Recovery  (PR). The term personnel recovery (PR) is used to describe \nthe recovery and reintegration of captured, missing or isolated personnel, during both \npeacetime and on operations, from uncertain or hostile environments through air enabled \nsearch and rescue (SAR), com bat recovery (CR). The principal parameters that dictate \nhow a recovery mission is conducted are the location of the isolated individual(s) and the \nlevel of threat posed.  \n• Peacetime Recovery . \no Search and Rescue  (SAR) .  Recover y of personnel in distress where hostile \ninterference is not  expected. This can include mountain rescue.  \no Deployed search and Rescue. These are SAR operations conducted \noutside the home nation as part of a disaster relief or humanitarian operation, \nor in support of a training exercise, where no hostile interference is expected.  \n• Combat Recovery.  \no Combat Recovery.   Recovery of non -detained isolated personnel from a \nsituation where  hostile interference may be expected, using conventional \ntactics, techniques  and procedures.  \no Combat Search & Rescue (CSAR) .  Recovery of non- detained isolated \npersonnel from a situation where hostile interference may be expected, using \nforces that are nationally designated and specifically trained and equipped to  \nconduct recovery.  \no Non-conventional Assisted Recovery . In the highest threat environments, \nrecoveries may be conducted through non- conventional assisted recovery \nmeans using SF or surrogate/indigenous forces that have been trained or equipped to assist in moving isolated personnel through a network that \nreturns them to the safety of friendly forces.  \n \n \nFigure 4.7 The Person nel Recovery Spectrum  \nSERIAL 1-02-05 \n1–02–05 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 SPACE DOCTRINE FUNDAMENTALS  \n5.1. This summary is taken from JDP 0- 40 UK Space Power  1st Ed (2022)   \n5.2. What is Space?  There is no agreement under international law as to the altitude at \nwhich airspace ends and outer space begins. From a practical perspective, outer space (the \nfinal frontier! !) begins  ‘above the highest altitude at which an aircraft can fly and below the \nlowest possible perigee of a satellite in orbit’.   This point is commonly known as the Kármán \nLine: a height approximately 100 kilometres above mean sea level, above which the \natmosphere becomes too thin for an aircraft to generate conventional lift without needing to \nexceed the speed required to achieve orbit. Thus, for practical purposes, anything in orbit or \nbeyond can safely be regarded as being in space.  \n5.3. Space as an Operational Domain.   Space is contested by both state and non- state \nactors. It is subject to expanding commercial competition and is congested by a growing \nvolume of satellites and debris. Increasing reliance on space, identified vulnerabilities and \nthe perception of challenge in space necessitated it  to be considered an operational domain.  \n5.4. What is Space Power ?  Space power is defined as: “exerting influence in, from, or \nthrough, space. ” (JDP 0 -40 Para 1. 3) \n5.5. Attributes  of the Space Domain . (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1.5) \n• Congested.   Traditionally, the use and exploration of space was only undertaken by \nthe major powers. In recent times, the lowering of technological the traditional \nbarriers and costs have trigger ed commercial expansion into space on an \nunparalleled scale.  \n• Complex .  The blurring of the lines between civilian and military, government and \ncommercial has drastically increased complexity in space.  \n• Critical .  Technological advances, underpinned by increasingly widespread \ncommercial or dual -use space capabilities, have imperceptibly permeated society \nand popular culture to such an extent that they are now almost indispensable, but \nthey are nonetheless taken almost completely for granted.  – eg GPS.  \n• Contested.  Many adversaries have space programmes themselves  and can source \ncapabilities commercially or have at least identified space to be a critical vulnerability . \n5.6. Aspects of the Space Domain .  It should be stressed that the following aspects \ncannot be taken in isolation: each affects and relies on the others.   (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1.7) \n• Political Aspects : \no Diplomatic .  To supports the growth of a commercial space sector . \no International Negotiations . To prevent an arms race in space  \no Legal .  The international legal framework for space is the Outer Space Treaty . \n• Military Aspects.  Most  military operations could not be sustained without space \ncapabilities .  Operations depend on space, principally for communications; \nmeteorological; positioning, navigation and timing functions; intelligence, surveillance \nand reconnaissance; and the ability to operate remotely piloted aircraft at range.  \n• Economic Aspects.   A thriving commercial space sector is valuable to Defence both \nfor developing innovative projects that offer the potential of delivering decisive \nmilitary advantage but also to reduce the costs and increase the capacity and \navailability of existing systems . \n• Social Aspects.   All modern states, depends on space services for day ‑to‑day \nsocietal functions such as enabling banking transactions, the effective operation of \nthe national power grid and the use of smartphones. However, the public are often unaware of this, or take assured access for granted, making it difficult to \nacknowledge our reliance on freedom of access to the space environment.  \n• Information Aspects.   The free flow of data and seamless functioning of networks \nare critical for space functions, both for control signals and the operation of payloads.  \nSERIAL 1-02-05 \n1–02–05 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Infrastructure Aspects.   Space operations are separated into three segments to aid \nunderstanding of the space system . \no Space segment . The space segment comprises elements of the space \nsystem in outer space itself .  There are t wo basic systems: the spacecraft \nitself and the payloads it carries. This differentiation is important as the two \ncan have different software, systems, ground segment elements and tasking \nchains.  \no Ground segment . The ground segment comprises terrestrial facilities that \nare used to launch, direct and control satellites as well as operate their \npayloads.  \no Link segment . The link segment connects the space and ground segments \nand comprises both the data itself and the medium used to carry it.  \n• Physical Environment Aspects .  The environment encountered by a spacecraft on \norbit can be extremely harsh, given it lacks the protection afforded terrestrial domains \nby the Earth’s atmosphere.   Three areas:  \no Orbits and orbital mechanics.  \no The space environment . Temperature, magnetic fields & vacuum.  \no Space Debris .  Tens of thousands of objects in orbit >  10cm  = impacts . \no Space Weather .  The sun’s activity causes solar flares, coronal mass \nejections and radiation storms.  \no Time .  Every satellite launched has a finite operational lifetime based on the \nfuel it carries and which it needs to operate its systems and manoeuvre to \nmaintain the orbit parameters it is launched on . \n5.7. Characteristics of Space Power . (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1.19) \n• Perspective . As with the air domain, space capabilities exploit the vertical \ndimension, albeit to a completely different order of magnitude.  \n• Access. The international rules and norms governing overflight of sovereign states by aircraft do not apply to satellites; space offers unrivalled access to any point on \nEarth, with no requirement to adhere to national boundaries.  \n• \nPersistence. Typically, the orbital life expectancy of satellites is measured in years or \neven decades, so they can overcome the air power limitation of impermanence.  \n• Versatility. Space assets are versatile because a single platform can carry a \nmultitude of sensors and capabilities to provide services simultaneously to multiple \nusers.  \n5.8. Limitations of Space Power . (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1. 20) \n• Cost . While the traditional cost barriers for space systems have dramatically \nreduced, they are still expensive.  \n• Vulnerability. Space systems possess vulnerabilities across all three segments.  \n• Predictability . Objects in space do not fly like aircraft, rather they fall in accordance \nwith the laws of orbital mechanics. Satellite orbits are therefore mostly predictable.  \n• Limited responsiveness. While limited responsiveness is still valid when \nconsidering larger exquisite capabilities (which are few in number and take years and \nsometimes decades to build and replace), increasingly, the ease with which small, \nalmost disposable satellites can be built and launched may mitigate this limitation to \nsome degree.  \n• Orbit congestion . While space itself is vast, the laws of orbital mechanics mean that \ncertain orbits, especially geosynchronous equatorial orbit  (GEO ), are extremely \nvaluable. Orbit slots in GEO are regulated by the International Telecommunication \nUnion . \n \nSERIAL 1-02-05 \n1–02–05 - 3 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 5.9. Space Power \nRoles.  The f our \nfundamental space  \npower roles are  shown \nin Figure 5B1.  They \nare a good framework within which to view \nactivity in space; \nhowever, they are not \nabsolute and overlap \nbetween the roles will inevitably occur.  \n5.10.  Space domain \nawareness . Space \ndomain awareness is defined as: the \nprovision of security -\nfocused, decision-\nquality information that \ncan be used to \nsuccessfully mitigate \nadversary space effects \nwhile supporting the integration of allied \nspace effects into multi -\ndomain operations.  \n(JDP 0 -40 from Para \n2.1) \n• Space surveillance and tracking. Space surveillance and tracking is defined as: the \ndetection, tracking and identification of objects in or entering the space domain, using \ndata from sensor observations and satellite operators, sufficient to deliver effective \nspace situational awareness , space domain awareness and missile warning.  \n• Space situational awareness. Space situational awareness is defined as: the \nprovision of sufficient understanding of the risks and hazards associated with domain \ncongestion and complexity to enable safe and effective space operations.  \n5.11.  Space Control . Space \ncontrol is defined as: the use \nof defensive and offensive \ncapabilities to assure access \nand freedom of action in \nspace.  (JDP 0 -40 from Para \n2.9) \n• Offensive space control .  These \noperations seek to \ndisrupt, degrade, deny \nor destroy the \nspace‑ related \ncapabilities and forces \nof an adversary.  \nFigure 5 .1 The Roles of \nSpace Power  \nFigure 5.2 \nSpace Control  \n\nSERIAL 1-02- 05 \n1–02– 05 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Defensive space control .  This  is conducted to protect space capabilities from\nattack, interference or unintentional hazards  consists of both passive and activ e\nm\neasures .\n5.12.  Space Support to Operations . This enables and enhances military capabilities, \nproviding critical support to the combat effectiveness of the joint force. It is divided into five \ncore functions, as shown in Figure 5B.3.  (JDP 0 -40 from Para 2.17) \n•I\nntelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance . The ISR role develops situational\nawareness and enhances understanding, helping shape the conduct of operations\n•Positioning, navigation and timing  (PNT) Space- derived PNT capabilities,\ndelivered using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), provide mission- essential\ndata and information, which enable the effective execution of military operations.\nThey provide precision navigation for military platforms and personnel; precisi on\ngui\ndance for smart weapons; and precision timing for data links and secur e\nc\nommunications.\n•Satellite communications. The ability to communicate and pass increasingly lar ge\nam\nounts of data beyond line of sight is an essential military requirement, since terrai n\nor\n horizon- masking can restrict radio communications. Satellite communications\n(SATCOM) relay data and voice transmissions through space, providing the ability toestablish communications at any point on the globe.\n•Missile warning and tracking.  Space -based missile warning systems are desi\ngned\nt\no detect, track, identify and assess ballistic missiles and their flight paths as well as\npredicting their likely time and point of impact. They form one component of an\noverall IAMD capability that must also integrate layers of surface- based sensors and\ninterceptors.\n•Environmental monitoring.  Data derived from space assets can provi de\ni\nnformation on meteorological, oceanographic and environmental factors that may\naffect the planning and execution of military operations, be it from space weather or\nterrestrial weather.\n5.13.  Space Service  Support .  This consists of operations that \nlaunch space assets and maintain and sustain them. It comprises \nlaunch operations and satellite operations.  (JDP 0 -40 from Para 2. 35) \n•Launch operations. These operations are fundamental to the ability to participate i n\ns\npace- based activities as they deliver satellites, payloads and material into space.\n•Satellite operations .

Informally (and in its very basic terms) successful logistics \ncomprises having materiel or services:  \n• in the right quantity;\n• in the right condition;\n• in the right place; and\n• at the right time.\n6.3. Logistics is defined in NATO as: “Logistics is the science of planning and carrying \nout the movement and maintenance of forces. In its most comprehensive sense, the aspects \nof military operations which deal with:  \n• design and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution,\nmaintenance, recovery and disposal of materiel;\n• transport of personnel;\n• acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of\nfacilities;• acquisition or furnishing of services; and\n• medical and health service support.”\n6.4.

Military Capability is the enduring ability to generate a desired \noperational outcome or effect, which is relative to the threat, physical environment, and \ncontributions of coalition partners. Military Capability is the Means, which is applied by the Ways to achieve the Ends.  \n7.2. There are 4 key aspects to a  military capability:  \n• The PLANNING  and analysis of what capability Defence need s and can afford.\n• The DESIGN  and DELIVERY  of the capability into Service.\n• The GENERATION of capability for operations, its deployment and\nsustainment .\n• The SUPPORT  of military capability  through its life.\n7.3. CADMID Cycle .   The life -cycle of a capability takes it through a number of key \nstages. These stages are grouped together under the acronym CADMID which stands for:  \nC\noncept – Assessment – Demonstration – Manufacture - In Service - Disposal  \nFigure 7.1   The CADMID Cycle  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Each of the six acquisition phases involves executing the plan agreed in the previous phase, \nreviewing the outcome, and planning for the remaining phases.  The basic activities of each \nphase are as follows:  \na. Concept Stage: The development of the User Requirement Document \n(URD) that provides a baseline statement of the outputs, results or effects the new \ncapability should deliver.  \nb. A\nssessment Stage:   This stage develops the URD into a System\nRequirement Document (SRD) which is an output -based statement of what t he\nc\napability must do to meet  the stated requirements in the URD.\nc. D\nemonstration Stage : Contractors develop demonstration/prototype\ncapabilities that they believe meet the URD & SRD.  The outcome of this stage isnormally the selection of a contractor.\nd. M\nanufacture Stage: The agreed solution is delivered to the military\nrequirement within the time and cost agreed. System acceptance is undertaken t o\nens\nure the System satisfies the SRD.\ne. In-S\nervice Stage: This stage is where the military capability is declared as\nbeing available for operational use.\nf. Disposal Stage: The final stage is disposal where the plans for the efficient,\neffective and safe disposal of the capability/equipment are put into effect.\nC\napability Planning and Analysis \n7.4. The Defence Operating Model . The Defence Operating Model describes the core \nactivities undertaken by a M inistry of D efence (MOD) . These activities deliver three outputs: \nDefence Policy, Military Capability and Military Operations.  \nFUNCTIONSGOVERNMENTENABLEPOLICY\nSTRATEGY\nCorporate\nPLANNING\nCorporate\nGOVERNANCEOP ERATEDefence Output\nMILITARY CAPABILITY\nDefence Output\nMILITARY OPERATIONSDefence Output\nDEFENCE POLICYGENERATE military capability\nFigure 7.2   The Defence Operating Model  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • The P\nolicy, Strategy, Planning and Governance activities are led at t he\nD\nefence- level by the MOD.\n• Generate is shorthand for generate today’s Military Capability and work with the\nMOD  to develop future capability. Under MOD  direction, it is the responsibility\nof the Military Commands.\n• Enable describes the support and specialist services provided by the Enabli ng\nO\nrganisations in areas such as HR, procurement of military equipment and the\nmanagement of infrastructure.\n• Operate is about conducting Military Operations when required by Ministers.\n• Functions these are key act ivities that need to be carried out in a coherent way\nacross defence. They cover such defence- wide activities as  finance , health,\ninfrastructure , intelligence, people, etc.\n7.5. Policy.  National Security Policy sets out what government ministries , who have \nsecurity responsibilities , must do now and in the future  to achieve the government’s security \nobjectives. In response to national security policy , MODs  generate Defence Policy. This  \nstates what defence specifically  needs to achieve.  Together these policies are the Ends.   \n7.6. Defence Strategy .  Defence Strategy is the MOD activity that involves setting and \nprioritising objectives, identifying,  and assessing different ways to achieve them and deciding \non the best way forward – these are the Ways.  These objectives are derived from Defence \nPolicy that has been agreed under the National Security Policy. Defence Strategy comprises of Defence Tasks and Defence Planning Assumptions. For example, the United Kingdom \nhas 25 Defence Tasks which describe all the activities which the UK MOD may employ \nmilitary capability on now and in the future – these are made public . Defence Planning \nAssumptions explain what levels of military capability are agreed for each military task, where in the world these tasks may take place, against what sort of enemy, working alongside which allies. It also details how many of the tasks can be done at the same time. \nThis level of detail is normally classified.   \n7.7. Defence Plan . The Defence Plan directs the work of the whole of the MOD  and is \nstructured around the Defence Tasks set out in the Defence Strategy.  As a sub -set of the \nstrategy, a plan is also Ways of applying Means. It is an annual plan which direct s the \nvarious commands  to deliver outputs to meet the overall strategy. The plan allocates \nappropriate resources to deliver these outputs through the budget process. The various \nCommands within defence write their own C ommand plans to meet the defence plan.  \n7.8. Policy, Strategy, Plans Linkage. There is a clear linkage between policy, strategy,  \nand plans. Policy is the highest -level direction on what is to be achieved. Policy directs \nstrategy  – whatever way forward is decided upon to meet strategic objectives, these must be \naligned to policy.  Plans  are developed by the MOD  to direct its activities and by commands  \ntake this direction and create their own plans . All plans  must be written to support the \nstrategy . Governance is the process which ensures that outputs directed in the Defence Plan \nare achieved and remain aligned to Defence Strategy and eventually policy.  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 7.\n9. Capability.  Capability is \ndelivered by Force Elements \ncombined into packages by Joint \nForce Commanders and tailored \nfor specific operations or \nmissions.  Force elements are \ntypically ships, aircraft  (ships and \naircraft are systems and not individual equipment ), army \nformations, other military units, or force enablers. Each force element is delivered by the \ncommands within Defence, \nwhether they be single service or joint.  \n7.10. Force Elements.  Force Elements are expressed as either Force Elements at \nReadiness  – FE@R o r Force Elements at S ustainability – FE@S. Force  Elements  at \nReadiness  – FE@R are Force  Elements t hat w ill be able to depl oy, with planned \nperformance  levels,  within a given notice period. The notice period is the l evel of R eadiness. \nForce Elements at S ustainability – FE@S - this is the sustainability of For ce Elements \nthroughout their a ssigned mission. \n7.11. Capability Gap Analysis.  Capability G ap Analysis i s a way t o identify po tential \nfuture capabilities t o meet D efence Strategy.  A Capability G ap occurs w hen analysis \nidentifies t hat there i s no capability t o meet a def ence strategy.  Capability G aps appear \nwhen: Policy  changes – when there i s a se curity r eview ; Strategy ch anges – when there are \nnew def ence  tasks or defence planning assumptions ( includes changes t o the enemy); or \nwhen Technology  changes . Capability gap anal ysis i s conducted by  the U sers w ho ar e the \nCommands w ith an MOD and follows a pr ocess  of: \n• I\ndentify timeframe – which force is capability operating with – When + Who.\n• Which operating environment the capability will be operating in – Where.\n• Which Tasks and Defence Planning assumptions :\no What tasks,\no How long - duration,\no with Who – joint?\no wit\nh Whom – allies  and\no Thr\neat.\n7.12.  Military Capability Requirements. A military capability requirement is a measurable \nand enduring description of the things that Defence needs to be able to do.  The Users write \nrequirements  – who are mostly the Commands within the MOD. Users bring with them the \n‘Way we fight’ plus Lessons Identified.  Requirements are written in a specific way  to \ndescribe what is needed rather tha n provide a solution. Requirements are written:  \n• The User shall be able to …\n• The User requires the ability to …….  Figure 7.3   The Military Capability  Model  \n\nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 R\nequirements should endeavour  to be written using the SMART methodology:  \n• Specific: Precise and stated in terms of result to be achieved .\n• Measurable: Easy to determine if result has been met .\n• Achievable: High standards but attainable .\n• Realistic: Aligned to performance needs .\n• Timely: Specified time frame for completion .\nCapability Design and Delivery  \n7.13.  The design and delivery of a capability  will always be a compromise between what \nyou need, how soon you  can get it and what you can afford.  Finding an acceptable balance \nbetween these, often competing, elements will usually  mean trade -offs/cost cutting  and \ntherefore knowing what the key aspects of  your capability  are vital to preserving the core of \nthe capability.     \n7.\n14. Procurement Options.   There are a number of procurement options  open to \nDefence:  \n• Develop with industry required bespoke Equipment .\n• Commercial Off the Shelf  (COTS) .\n• Modified Off the Shelf  (MOTS).\n• Buy Second Hand .\n• Gifting .\n• Defence can buy or lease a capability  with a variety of contracts with industry :\no Contract against a detailed Specification (I want one of these)\no Contract against an outline specification  (I want something that does this)Figure 7. 4   The \nCapability \nCompromise Trinity  SPEED\nQUALITY\n& SCOPECOST\nLow  \nQuality  \nImpossible  \nEXPENSIVE  \n SLOW  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 o Cont\nract for Availability  (I want this number at this time)\no Contract for Capability  (I want the ability to….)  \no Contract for Outcome  (I want these results)\n7.15.  Defence Lines of \nDevelopment .  When \nputting in place a capability \nDefe nce will use the \nDefence Lines of Development template as a \nway to ensure all the elements that make up a capability are covered when \nbuilding it. Also see SOHB 4 -07-01. \nG\nenerating Capability \n7.16.  The generation of Capability is about getting WHAT  you need, WHEN you want it,  \nWHERE  you want it and for  HOW  LONG  you want it  in place for. Having a force always \nready for anything is both unaffordable and probably unachievable.  The cost of having a unit at high readiness will be balanced against risk (Impact and likelihood) together with the likely \nwarning time of any potential threat or deployment situation. \n7.17.  Readiness.  The term “Readiness” is \nused to describe the means by which \nDefence holds its military forces at varying levels of preparedness to respond to emerging threats or operations.  The \nreadiness categories of 1 to 11 are used by \nthe UK military and are shown in Figure 7.6 .  \nThey equate to the time a unit has to be ready to deploy on operations appropriately manned, equipped, trained,  and supported \nto meet the defined requirements and standards set out in the Defence requirements.   Having Force Elements at a \nform of readiness i s known as FE@R . \n7.18.  Assessment and Reporting \nReadiness.  An effective system of assessing and reporting this readiness is an essential element of a credible system.  In the table 7.6  below  3 assessments of units and formations \nare considered:  Figure 7. 5   Defines Lines of Development : \nTEPID OIL  \nFigure 7. 6   UK Force Readiness  \n\nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • The \nfirst (B1)\nmeasures t he\npos\nition of Force\nElements in\nrelation to theirpeacetimereadiness states .\n• The sec\nond\nme\nasure (B2 )\npr\novides an\nassessment ofthe ability ofthose Force Elements t\no\nac\ntually get themselves ready to deploy on operations once ordered to do so.\n• The final measure (B3) looks at the ability to actually deploy to theatre and\nconduct and sustain operations.\n7.19.  Sustainability .  The second element of Readiness is sustainability .  Deploying a \nforce quickly is one thing , having the ability to keep it in the fight is another. Having Force \nElements who are sustainable in a future deployment is known as FE@S .  There are 2 \nelements  to FE@S: \n• How much materiel is needed to sustain the force on the operation for t he\ndur\nation required?  This is a combination of the Daily consumption Rate a nd\nt\nhe forecast duration of the potential task.\n• How much of this materiel needs to be on the shelf for a force at a certai n\nReadi\nness ? This is a combination of the capacity of industry to provide th e\nr\nequired material over the warning time a force has  prior to  deploy ment .\nFigure 7.8 below illustrate s how FE@ S may well be a combination of ‘ Just in C ase’ stock on \nthe shelf and Just in Time stock purchased during the warning time. Less Warning time more \n“Just in Case” stock required.   \nThr\nough Life Support  \n7.20.  There are 3 key guiding principles when looking at supporting capability . These are : \nFigure 7. 7   Readiness Assessment\nFigure 7. 8   \nCalculating FE@S  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n• Think\n Whole Life - Support represents the greater part of the whole life cost\n• Be aware that The Support costs are ‘baked in’ early in the CADMID cycle with\n70% cost determined before they start making it.\n• The Aim of “capability support ” sits in the area of capability generation. It aims\nto produce Operational Availability: through the life of the capability: at Value\nfor money for Defence .\n7.21.  Supportability Analysis .  A Supportability analysis hopes to influence the Design \nitself as well as identifying the “S upport ” cost drivers, issues, and requirements. The output \nis the creation of a support plan for the capability.  There are 3 key stages to the analysis:  \n• Design for Support – making sure the design of the capability has support\nfeatures factored in from the outset.\n• Design the Support – Designing the key elements of the maintenance concepts\nthat will provide the expected availability at value for money for Defence.\n• Support the Design – this is a deep analysis into all the support that is needed\nby the various elements for the overall operation and integration of the system.\nFigure 7. 9   Supportability Analysis  \n7.22. Availability.   Defence must be clear on what availability it wants/ gets from a \ncapability and test  and assess  before it buy s. It needs to l ook a t what p revents t he capability \nfrom bei ng available – its \nreliability,  maintainability \nand supportability - and \nfeature these  when \nlooking at the numbers it \nneeds to buy and the \nsupport packa ge it need s \nto put i n place.

Role of the HQ and Organisation of the Staff .  The HQ is a secure base for the \ncommander and the staff, which includes the Joint Operations Centre  (JOC ) and the \nadministrative  and security organisations that protect, sustain and move the commander and \nthe staff.   The role of any HQ is to:  \n•P\nlan operations in support of the Commander’s Intent;\n•Execute control of operations;\n•Provide Situational Awareness and SME advice to the commander so that he can\ncommand operations.\nIn order to deliver its functions with the flexibility to adjust to the operational need, HQs are \nmodular and will have a number of configurations.  eg MAIN HQ, FWD HQ  or ADV HQ .  The \nlocation is a command decision.  HQs can be located on land, afloat, inside or outside the JOA.   \n1.2. Functional Groupings.  All HQ s have three main groupings  of people: \n•C\nommand Group ; the Commander, his personnel staff and principle advisors.\n•Staff  Group; consisting of  staff branches  1-9, as shown below  in figure 1.1, who c an\nbe t\nask organised to provide further functional groups, such as the Principal Planni ng\nG\nroup (PPG) and the Staff Joint Force Planning Group (J FPG) that also exist for the\nplanning cycle - roles for these planning groups are explained in part 3.  Additional\nfunctional groupings may be created for specific tasks, as they are required.\n•Command Support Element ; this provides Communications and Informati on\nS\nystems (CIS), as well as expeditionary life support and force protection for t he\nheadquar\nters.\n1.3. Component HQ Staff Branch Names .  Each Service uses a different letter prefix for \nthe HQ staff branch:   They all carryout the same broad functions.  \nJoint  J1 J2 J3 J4 J5 J6 J7 J8 J9 \nMaritime  N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 N8 N9 \nLand G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 G6 G7 G8 G9 \nAir A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 \nUSA Bn  S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 \nMulti -Nat CJ1 CJ2 CJ3 CJ4 CJ5 CJ6 CJ7 CJ8 CJ9 \n1.4.

At the joint level , execution does not tend to follow- on directly from planning.  \nIn the Prepare part of the  Plan – Prepare – Execute cycle , plans are revised and refined, this \nis the role of the J3/5 staff .  Within campaign planning, phases of the OPLAN are refined and \nturned into executable Joint Coordination Orders or JCOs.

Chief of Staff .  A Chief of Staff (COS) is responsible for operations, operations \nsupport, plans and intelligence. He coordinates work across the headquarters, with particular \nresponsibility for information management. He is pivotal to the efficient running of the \nheadquarters; a good COS can engender and sustain mutual trust and understanding \nbetween individual staff mem bers, advisers and subordinate headquarters.  \n2.2. Deputy Chief of Staff .  A Deputy COS (DCOS) coordinates logistics, personnel and \noften finance. Though normally of equivalent rank, the COS is primus inter pares.  \n2.3. Policy Adviser . The Policy Adviser (POLAD) advises a JTFC on the international, \nregional and local political context, as well as UK Government policy.  \n2.4. Legal  Adviser .  A Legal Adviser (LEGAD) provides legal advice and is pivotal to all \naspects of planning and execution. Targeting and rules of engagement, for instance, will \ndemand his close scrutiny and input.  \n \n2.5. STRATCOM - Media Adviser . A media adviser brings technical and cultural \nunderstanding of media processes and agendas. This shapes not only direct media \nengagement, but also wider activity, through better understanding of how events are likely to \nbe reported and perceived.  \n2.6. Scientific Advisers.  Scientific Advisers (SCIADs), when embedded, provide \noperational analysis support to planning, execution and assessment.  \n2.7. Subject Matter Experts.  A JTFC may employ subject matter experts to advise on \nlocal or regional issues. They may, for example, be indigenous or foreign academics who provide guidance on culture, economy and religion.  \n2.8. Interpreter or Translator Support .  Skilled and experienced interpreters or \ntranslators enhance a JTFHQ considerably. However, locally employed civilians, while \nreadily available, may not always be impartial or reliable.  \nFigure  2.1 showing the principal Staff Officers & Advisors  \nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 1 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 JTFHQ GENERIC STAFF BRANCH & CROSS FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES  \n3.1. Generic Staff Structures .  Most HQs are organised in a generic J1 to J9 structure \nas shown in figure 3.1 along with each branch’s responsibilities.\nFigure 3. 1 Showing  Generic J Staff Branch Responsibilities  \nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 3.2. Cross  Functional Staff Structures .  Figure s 3.2 and 3.3 show how cross functional \nstaff structures integrate members of the J Branch staff to focus on specific requirements \nand support battle rhythm. The cross -functional organization of the staff must facilitate the \nplanning and decision -making processes that are crucial to the JTF HQ .  As a practical \nmatter, the staff should only establish and maintain those cross -functional organizations that \nenhance planning and decision -making within the HQ.  They establish, modify, and dissolve \nthese entities as the needs of the JTF HQ evolve.  \nFigure 3. 2 Cross Functional Staff  Organisations . \n3.3. ACOS of a J - Staff Branch. The role of the Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) of each \ngeneric functional J – Branch is to serve as the principle subject matter expert advisor to the \nCJTF and assist him in the planning, direction and control of operations to achieve his \nmission.  As ACOS he leads, directs and coordinates his overall J function al branch area s of \nresponsibility.  \n3.4. DACOS of a J - Staff Branch.  The role of the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff \n(DACOS) of each generic functional J – Branch is to act as the deputy to the ACOS and act \nin his place if he is absent.   He is responsible to his ACOS for leading any specified areas of \nhis branch.  \nTypes of Cross Functional Staff Organisations  (AJP -3) \n3.5. Centre .  Centres are permanent, cross functional staff integrating organizations. A \ncentre is an enduring functional organization, with supporting staff, designed to perform a \njoint function within the JTF HQ. Often, these organizations have designated locations or  \nfacilities. Examples of centres include the JOC and the joint personnel recovery centre. The \nJOC is the most familiar centre typically found in a joint HQ with dedicated manning and \nfacilities to integrate the activities of the staff for current operations.  The JOC focuses on \nsupporting the direct, monitor, assess, and plan functions for the commander.  \n3.6. Group .  A group is an enduring functional organization formed to support a broad \nfunction within a JTF HQ.  Normally, groups within a JTF HQ include a Joint Force  Planning \n\nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 Group (J FPG) that manages JTF HQ planning.  JFPG functions include leading designated \nplanning efforts, resourcing and managing subordinate planning teams, and coordinating \nplanning activities with other staff directorates.  \n3.7. Cell.  A cell is a subordinate organization formed around a specific process, \ncapability, or activity within a designated larger organization of a JTF HQ.  A cell usually is \npart of both a functional and traditional staff structures.  An example of a cell within the \ntraditional staff structure could be a fire support coordination cell subordinate to the \noperations branch within the J -3.  An example of a cell within a functional staff structure \ncould be a current operations cell within the JOC.  \n3.8. Bureau .  A bureau is a long -standing functional organization, with a supporting staff \ndesigned to perform a specific function or activity within a JTF HQ.  A joint visitors bureau is \nan example of a bureau common to many JTFs.  \n3.9. Office .  An office is an enduring organization that is formed around a specific activity \nwithin a JTF HQ to coordinate and manage support requirements.  An example of an office \nis the joint mortuary affairs office.  \n3.10.  Element .  An element is an organization formed around a specific function within a \ndesignated directorate of a JTF HQ.  The subordinate components of an element usually are \nfunctional cells.  An example of an element is the joint fires element and the joint intelligence \nsupport element.  \n3.11.  Boards .  A board is an organized group of individuals within a JTF HQ, appointed by \nthe commander (or other authority) that meets with the purpose of gaining  guidance or \ndecision.  Its responsibilities and authority are governed by the authority that established the \nboard.  Boards are chaired by a senior leader with members representing major staff \nelements, subordinate commands, liaison officers, and other organizations as required.  Two \ndifferent types of boards are usually formed.  \n• Command Board . A command board is chaired by the commander, and its\npurpose is to gain guidance or decision from the commander.\n• Functional Board . A functional board’s purpose is to gain functionally\nspecific guidance and decisions from the commander (or designated representative)\nbased on a staff recommendation.  These boards often focus on synchronizing a\nparticular function, allocating resources between ongoing or future operations, or\nmaintaining continuity of purpose across ongoing operations.\n3.12.  Working Group . A working group (WG) is a permanent or ad hoc organization within \na JTF HQ formed around a specific function whose purpose is to provide analysis to users. \nThe WG consists of a core functional group and other staff and component representatives.  \n3.13.  Planning  Team. A planning team is a functional element formed within the JTF HQ \nto solve problems related to a specific task or requirement.  Planning teams and WGs are \ncomplementary.  WGs enhance planning through their provision of functional staff estimates \nto multiple planning teams. In contrast, planning teams integrate the functional concepts of \nmultiple functional WGs into plans and orders.  The planning team is not enduring and \ndissolves upon completion of the assigned task.  \nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 4 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 Figure 3. 3 Example of an HQ with

KLF \nDivision  The KLF consists of 2 x Mechanised and 2 x Armoured Brigades \nsupported by Combat and combat service support units. \nDivisions are grouped within a corps, Joint  Task Force (JTF) or a \ntheatre framework.  Brigades are grouped within divisions.  The \nDivision is resourced to plan and execute simultaneous tactical  \nengagements, whilst at the same time, planning the next set of \ntactical engagements to allow operational tempo to be maintained. \nThe division provides the direction, and sets the conditions for, \nsubordinate brigade activity. This includes the employment or allocation of  forces and assets held at the divisional level.  \nThe KLF Division fights the deep battle, resources the close battle \nand protects the rear  areas:  \n•Fight the Deep Battle . The deep battle is where the divisional\ncommander shapes the battlespace to enable success in t\nhe\nc\nlose battle. The deep battle must be appropriately resourc ed\nand s\nynchronised with the close battle.\n•Resource the Close Battle. The conduct of the close battle is the\nbusiness of the subordinate brigades within the division. Thedivision directs, shapes, enables and sustains brigade activity.\n•P\nrotect the Rear Areas. Operations in the rear area sustain the\ndivision. Physically this includes the protection of lines of\ncommunication forward to the brigades and rearward to the UK\nand its coalition partners. Elements of the rear protection task\nmay be delegated to the logistic brigade.\n1.2  Mech  & \nArmd  \nBdes The brigade provides a potent balance of span of  command, function \nand combat power. As a guide, brigades:  \n•PLAN : Are capable of concurrently planning a tactical acti on\nwh\nilst executing another within a relatively  limited decision/acti on\ncycl\ne.\noIn a complex stabilisation operation, brigade planning may\ninvolve detailed, multi -stakeholder engagement over a\nprotracted timescale.\noIn a dynamic warfighting action, where tempo is key,brigade planning and battle procedure must be mor\ne\nr\napid.  Achieving tempo will require appropriate command\nand control, with an emphasis on rapid planning timelines,\nfragmentary orders (FRAGOs) and the battlefiel d\nc\nirculation of commanders to gauge tactical progress  and\nprovide direction.\n\nSERIAL 2-07-01 \n2–07–01 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 • EXECUTE :  The Brigade can execute Tactical Activities \n(Offensive, Defensive, Stability and Enabling)  in space that is \ngenerally determined by the range of organic direct fire and \nhabitually aligned combined Arms and Combat Support capabilities in close combat (typically around 25 km) –  \nrecognizing that factors like population numbers, terrain, mass, intensity and effect have a bearing on space;  \n• C2:  Enable through task organization and command the \nmanoeuvre of up to four (five in extremis) Battlegroup points of command.  \no Exercise command within a defined C3I12envelope, \ndelivered primarily by tactical CIS, including Combat Net Radio (CNR) and this has a bearing on space.  \no Are the lowest levels of command where joint and multi -\nnational capabilities  are integrated (recognizing that there \nare exceptions in certain circumstances);  \n• SUSTAINMENT :  The brigade must be able to s ustain , as a \nyardstick , no more than two tactical engagements thus requiring  \nfive days of supply.  \n1.3 \n Tank  \nBattalion Armoured Battalions (3 x Tank Companies of 14 tanks) provide the \nbrigade’s principal protected, precision shock action capability.  The \nbrigade should train to generate flexible groupings of armour, \nmechanised infantry, fire support and manoeuvre support to meet the \ntactical need.  \n1.4 \n Mech \nInfantry  \nBattalion Mechanised Infantry Battalions (3 x Mech Companies of 14 APC)  \ncan conduct a range of activities.  They offer high utility in stabilisation \noperations, infantry mass for complex  terrain and  holding ground with  \nthe ability to redeploy forces  for exploitation beyond the contact battle \nwith adequate protection.  The brigade will need to consider how task \norganise between armoured and mechanised forces.  \n1.5 \n Anti-tank \nBattalion Anti-tank Battalion (4 x Companies of 18 x TOW Missile HMMWV)  \nare a rapid, light, mobile capability used to:  \n• Defeat enemy armour  \n• Screen Flanks  \n• Direct Fire support  \n1.6 \n Brigade \nRecon \nCompany  HMMWV  equipped; r oles:  \n• Find the enemy -  obtain timely intelligence and pass it back to \nBrigade HQ   \n• Screening – forward or flank protection.  \n• Scouting for information.  \n• Patrol ling \n\nSERIAL 2-07- 01 \n2–07– 01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 1.7 Artillery \nBattalion  K uwaiti Brigades hold an affiliated Close Support Mechanised \nArtillery  Battalion under command.

What are Planning Concepts and Tools?  Throughout planning, in addition to the \nestimate process, you will use a set of theoretical building blocks and tools, called the \nPlanning Concepts and Planning Tools; or, in NATO, the Operational Design Concepts \n(ODCs) and Operational Design Tools .   \n1.2. The planning concepts  and tools  are a useful aid to help the commander and the \nstaff think through the challenges of understanding the operating environment : \n•Analysing the strategic , operational and tactical  factors  where appropriate ,\n•defining the problem,\n•developing an approach, which guides planning and shapes the concept of\noperations  (CONOPS)\nSome planning concepts such as Centre of Gravity and Phases, are a useful method to \nbring order to higher level tactical plans  where they are complex, sequenced or managed \nover significant periods of time. For example, a brigade conducting a complex stabilisation operation that spans years may find a planning concept such as a Line of Operation (LoO) of \nuse.  The HQ may also choose to display its tactical plan using a schematic based on \nplanning concepts.  The use of planning concepts at the higher tactical level is about \nexploiting a useful methodology; it is not about campaign planning at the tactical level, nor is it a mandatory  part of tactical planning.  \n1.3. Planning Concepts e xamples include: ( AJP-5 Ed A, V2, Ch1  page 3 -6) \n•End State •Operational pause\n•(Initial ideas for) transition & termination.  • Sequencing and phases:\n•Centres of gravity. oPhases\n•Direct versus indirect approach. oSynchronisation, synergy & leverage\n•Objectives. oSimultaneity & depth\n•Decisive conditions oTempo\n•Effects and actions. oBranches & Sequels\n•Lines of operation oDecision Points\n•Culmination.\n1.4.

End State  Definition .  “The political and/or military situation to be attained at \nthe end of an operation, which indicates that the objective has been achieved.”AAP- 06 \n•The term ‘end state’ can be used by commanders at all levels , not just at the s trategic , to \ndefine the situation to be ac hieved at the end of a miss ion. Three types : Strategic, Military \nStrategic, Operational.  Term end state not normally used at tactical level in Land the \nterm “outcome” is preferred. (See AF M Command + Table 6.8.1 & 2). \nKuwait’s Strategic End state would be set by His Highness the Emir in \nconsultation with his Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Higher Defence Council. \nThe Strategic End state is called the “National Strategic Aim” in UK. The \nnational strategic aim provides the unifying purpose for strategic and operational \nlevel commanders, and leaders from non -military organisations. – Policy ‘Ends’ Decided by \nthe Prime Minister & National Security Council (NSC) (see JDP 01 Para1.28).  National \nStrategic Aim is set by NSC and stated in CDS Directive. \nNATO’s Strategic End state.  The end state is  the North Atlantic Council \n(NAC) statement of conditions that defines an acceptable concluding situation \nfor NATO’s involvement.   Issued in North Atlantic Council Initiating Directive (NID) & \nSACEUR Directive.  \n1.7. Military Strategic End state: “is the extent of the military  contribution to meeting the \nnational strategic aim  and objectives .”  (JDP 01  Para 1.30.) \n1.8. Operational End state: The extent of the Joint Task Force’s contribution to meeting \nthe military strategic end -state.   \n1.9. Transition: “the process or a period of changing from one state or condition to \nanother.”   \n1.10.  Termination .  “The process for bringing something to an end” (Oxford English \nDictionary)  \n•These planning c oncepts are normally used more in Strategic, Military Strategic,\nOperational -level planning.\n•Campaigns evolve and change in character  as they progress over time.  It is normal for\nmilitary forces to conduct different types of m ilitary activity and transition  from one type of\noperation to another.  The cessation of hostilities represents a particular transition,\nindicating the termination of ‘combat’ operations and the beginning of a move from\nmilitary to civil primacy, political conflict resolution, stabilisation & reconstruction.  (See\nAJ\nP-5 Para 3.8 )\n1.11.  Transition & Termination Planning . Consider the following – at the start of \nplanning:   \n•Is there a clear statement of exit criteria that support the desired end state?\n•What is the strategy for conflict termination? Is early termination more desirable than\ncontinued military operations?\n•How can military operations contribute to future long- term stability while avoiding sowi ng\nt\nhe seeds for future conflict?\n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 3 \nOr\niginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Who must assume control of the situation once termination criteria are met?  What\nresources and capabilities are required?\n1.12.  Centre Of Gravity (CoG):  “Characteristics, capabilities or localities from which a \nnation, an alliance, a military force or other grouping derives its freedom of action, physical \nstrength or will to fight.”   (AAP- 06 Definition)  \n•Pl\nanning concept and analysis tool u sed at: Strategic; Operational and tactical levels.\n(See Annex B AJP -5 Ed A V2 Ch1)\n•A C\noG is the primary source of power that provides an actor  (Friendly, Enemy or\nNeutral)  its strength, freedom of action, or will to fight. It is always a physical entity. At\nthe political strategic level, moral -strength as well as physical -strength CoGs exist. At\nlower levels of command, only physical -strength CoGs normally exist.\n•Be i\nt a physical or moral strength, i t is always an entity. An en tity is a thing with a distinct\nand independent existence.\n•CoG\ns have critical capabilities (abilities – what the CoG can do in context of the actor’s\nmission), critical requirements (means, resources, and conditions  essential for a CoG to\nperform its critical capabilities), and critical vulnerabilities  (deficient, missing, or\nvulnerable critical requirements) .\n1.13.  T\nypes of \nCoG  The C oG at \neach level should \nbe linked to achieving the \naim and \nobjectives for \nthat level  as it is \nthe primary \nstrength needed  \nto achieve the objective . \n•PhysicalStrength\nCoG\n•Moral\nStrength\nCoG.\nFigure 1.2 CoG types and linkages at e ach level of war \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.\n14. Moral \nStrength  Centre \nof Gravity .  CoGs  \nrepresenting a \nmoral strength exist at the \npolitical -strategic  \nlevel . An actor’s \nmoral strategic \nCoG is the primary entity that \ninherently  \npossesses most of the following \ncritical \ncapabilities: \ndetermines (and can alter) policy \nand strategy, commands the \nresources and \nmeans required  to \nachieve the strategic objectives, and inspires and provides moral  cohesion and will to fight. \nIn short, it is the actor’s political- strategic  decision- making entity.  \nExamples of Moral Strategic CoGs include: \n•a strong political leader,\n•a religious leader or organization wielding decisive political power,\n•a ruling elite, and a strong- willed population (or a segment of it) determined to\nprevail.\nAs a consequence, ‘ Gold Alliance  cohesion’ cannot  be a moral strategic CoG (it is not an \nentity); instead,  the primary entity that provides Alliance cohesion, such as the political \nleadership can be the Alliance’s  moral strategic CoG. Likewise, elements such as ethnic \nnationalism or  ideology cannot be CoGs (they are not entities); rather, they can be a critical \nrequirement for the  actors  political leadership (the real moral CoG) to be able to inspire and \nprovide moral cohesion and the will to fight.   \n1.15.  A Physical Strength Centre of Gravity .  CoGs representing a physical strength \nexist, in principle , at each level of command. Thus, it is the entity representing the primary \nphysical strength an actor depends on to carry out its (assumed) intent and achieve its \n(assumed) objectives at that  given level of command.  \n• Strategic Level  CoG .  At the political -strategic level, they are called physical\nstrategic CoGs; examples include a coalition or alliance military task force,  a\npar\nticular strong element of national military power, a national security force, a\npolitical group’s military arm, or  even a strong non- military entity in case the mai n\ns\ntrategic effort is not a military one.\n• Operational -level  CoG .  At the joint force command level, they are call ed\noper\national CoGs; examples include an armoured corps, air component forces,  a\nm\naritime task force, a national police force, a regional network of insurgent cells.\nOperational CoGs are normally central elements or constituent parts of the physical\nstrategic CoG; i.e., they should be nested within the strategic CoG. As an example,\nFigure 1.3 Possible types  & examples  of Strategic COG  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 the national police force (operational CoG) is a constituent part of the national \nsecurity force (physical strategic CoG). The physical strategic CoG is not necessarily \nnested within the moral strategic CoG, but it is chosen and controlled by it.  \n• Tactical Level  CoG .  Although CoG Analysis usually takes place in th e\nS\ntrategic & Operational Estimate, the method can have applicability wherever a CoG\ncan be identified. The key output of CoG Analysis is the identification ofvulnerabilities which may  then be exploited (enemy) or protected/enabled (friendly) or\nboth (civilian). Centre of Gravity Analysis at the tactical level is discussed in Annex\n8B of ADP Land Operations 2016.\n1.\n16. The Contextual or Changing Nature of Physical C entre of Gravities.   Normally, \nmissions and objectives can be achieved in various ways that potentially use different primary physical strengths (i.e. physical CoGs); consequently, identifying the various ways \nan actor can achieve its objectives is a critical step in identifying an actor’s potential  physical \nCoGs.  Defeating an actor’s physical CoG at a given level defeats the actor’s current \nstrategy/COA at that level. This forces the actor to change to another strategy/COA (that depends on another CoG) if one exists, and it might force  the actor to change its objectives \n(at that level) as well. Accordingly, an actor’s CoG might change if the actor changes the primary physical strength used to achieve its objectives. As such, operational CoGs might \nchange from phase to phase of an operation, and consequently, several operational CoGs \nmight exist for an operation, but normally not simultaneously. Still, if an actor pursues two or \nmore strategies simultaneously, each using different physical strengths, and each capable of  \nachieving the actor’s objectives by itself, then multiple CoGs can in principle exist \nsimultaneously.  \n1.17.  Method  - How to identify and validate a potential physical Centre of Gravity :  \nThe Commander at each level of command  is responsible for the selection  of the related \nCentre of Gravity during his mission analysis .  He does this, supported by his staff, and \nconfirms his selection in the Mission Analysis Brief.   The outline process is:  \n•Identify the actors (assumed) objectives  – what the actor  is trying to achieve.\n•Identify the actors (assumed) strategy / Course of Action for achieving thes\ne\nobj\nectives.\n•Identify possible Centre of Gravit y candidates  and validate them using the followi ng 3\nques\ntions :Figure 1.4 \nCharacteristics \nof Centres  of \nGravity  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 o Q. One: Is the CoG candidate the primary capability o r military force  used by\nthe actor to achieve the (assumed)  objectives at that level of command?\nIf it is an important or even essential capability, but not the primary one  used\nby\n the actor to achieve its objectives, then it is a  critical requirement for the real\nCoG.\nI\nf it is not an entity but rather an important condition that must be present for\nthe actor to achieve its  objectives, then it is likewise a critical requirement for the\nreal CoG.\no Q. Two: Does the CoG candidate possess the most critical capabilities\n(abilities) required to achieve the actor’s objectives at the analysed level of\ncommand? If some critical capabilities are missing, then support from the entities\npossessing them becomes critical requirements for the CoG .\no Q. Three : If the CoG candidate is defeated, does this defeat the actor’s\n(assumed) COA at that level of command? If not, the candidate might be a CoG for\nanother possible COA for the actor.\n1.18.  CoG Analysis: The CoG analysis model is used to analyse an actor as a system in \norder to identify conditions and effects that need to be established to achieve own \nobjectives. The most effective way to affect an actor to meet the required conditions for \nachieving own objectives is through the actors CoG(s). To assist in finding ways to achieve \nthe required condition of a specific CoG,  commanders and their staff should analyse the \nCoG using the concepts of : \nCoG C ritical Capabilities, Critical Requirements & Critical Vulnerabilities \n1.19.  Critical Capabilities  (CC)  – What the CoG can do – its primary abilities – in relation \nto achieving the actor’s objectives at the given level in the context of a given environment. \nThe critical capability concept is useful to identify and validate CoGs, as it expresses how an \nactor  can use a particular strength (the CoG candidate) to achieve the actor’s objectives at \nthe analysed  level of command.  \n1.20.  Critical Requirements  (CR)  – are specific conditions, resources, and/ or means that \nare essential for a CoG to perform its critical capabilities.   \n1.21.  Critical Vulnerabilities (CV) – are those critical requirements, or components thereof, \nthat are deficient, missing, or vulnerable to influence in a way that will contribute to a CoG \nfailing to perform one or more of its critical capabilities. The lesser the risk and cost, the better.  \n1.22.  The CoG analysis matrix. The table below provides one method for using the CoG \nanalysis model to analyse an actor’s physical CoG at a generic level of command; other \nmethods may be used. Moral strategic CoGs are analysed  in a similar way. There are 2 basic \napproaches to using the analysis matrix  at Fig 1.5.  \n•Both approaches  start with the actor’s assessed objectives and potential COAs but\nthen take different start points routes around the matrix:\n•Usually, you would identify and validate the CoG first, as described above, as part ofthe process that determines how each actor will achieve its objectives.\n•Alternatively, some analysts might prefer first to identify the critical capabilities\n(abilities) the actor requires to achieve its (assumed) objectives, and then identify theprimary entity (C oG) that possesses the most of those critical capabilities.\nHowever, since CoG analysis is a continuous, iterative process, the order of doing either  box \nit is not important  as long as you follow the clockwise direction of the matrix  afterwards .  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 Centre of Gravity Analysis Matrix\n      Assessed Objectives and potential COAs : (note actor and level of command) The \nactor’s (assumed) main objectives & potential COAs for achieving them, at the analysed  \ncommand level.

Direct Approach: “is a sequential or simultaneous, uninterrupted approach against \nan adversary’s COG, often by way of DC/DPs. This approach may mean engaging the \nadversary’s strengths.”  \n1.24.  Indirect Approach: “The Manoeuvrist Approach...is an example of an indirect \napproach. The indirect approach seeks to exploit the adversary’s physical and moral \nvulnerabilities whilst avoiding its strengths.” (See AJP- 5 Para \n0245)  \n1.25.   An important point in \nplanning an operation is to \ndetermine the best approach for \ndealing with the adversarial CoGs. Two alternative \napproaches to consider are the \ndirect and indirect approaches. \nThe direct approach attacks the \nadversary’s CoG or principal \nstrength by applying combat \npower directly against it. The indirect approach typically seeks \nto circumnavigate, isolate, or \notherwise render combat \nineffective rather than physically \ndestroy the adversarial CoG(s). In some cases, an indirect \napproach may require a series of operations against multiple critical vulnerabilities. In other \ncases, it may involve a single operation against a few particularly critical vulnerabilities that \nhas the effect of creating the required condition of the CoG, but without engaging in direct \nbattle with adversary’s primary combat units. Deciding between the two approaches is a question of weighing factors such as relative strength, Alliance capabilities, the types of \nadversarial critical vulnerabilities, risk appetite and tolerance, the required condition of the \nadversarial CoG, time, etc . \n•Direct approach: Is appropriate when a force has superior strength compared to the  \nopposing force and the risk is acceptable. Engages CoG’s critical c apabilities.\n•Indirect approach: Is appropriate when a force lacks sufficient capability to operate  \ndirectly against an advisory’s CoG, or if the risks of a direct approach are deemed  \nunacceptable. Commanders should concentrate on exploiting the adversary’s critical  \nvulnerabilities that will eventually lead to the defeat of the CoG. \n1.26.  Objectives: “a clearly defined and attainable goal for a military operation, or \nachieving some other desired outcome that is essential to a commander’s plan and \ntowards which the operation is directed” (AAP -06 Definition)  \n “A clearly defined & attainable goal to be achieved” (COPD – proposed new \nDefinition)  \n•Types : Strategic, Military Strategic, Operational and can also be used at Tactical level.\nNational Strategic Objectives : “a goal to be achieved through one or more \ninstruments of national power to meet the national strategic aim.” (JDP 01 (1.29)) Figure 1.6 Illustrating the Direct & Indirect Approach\n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.27.  Military Strategic Objectives : “goals to be achieved by the military to meet the \nnational strategic aim (and are the responsibility of the military -strategic commander \n(CDS)).” NATO uses the same term.  (JDP 01 Paras 1.31.)  \n1.28.  Operational Objectives : “relate to a single theatre of operations and are ‘owned’ by \nthe respective JFC.”  (JDP 01 Paras 1.33.) \n1.29.  Tactical Objectives : “at the tactical level, they should be clearly defined and \nattainable” (AFM Command) normally they would be included in the Commanders Intent \nStatement.  \n1.30.  Who Writes the Objectives?  Military objectives are normally given by the level \nabove and included in the mission statement of the responsible command (i.e. UK strategic \nmilitary level by CDS or operational- level by CJO).  \n1.31.  How to write objectives : Focused at the level for which they are written, each \nobjective:  \n•Is a brief statement that clearly defines a single , attainable goal or ‘end’ to be achieved,\nwithout prescribing the way or means.\n•Contributes to the achievement of the end state (or outcome at tactical -level).\n•Is written as something to be achieved.\n•Examples:\noRedland Government deterred.\noRedland forces removed from Blueland territory.\n1.32.  Decisive Condition (DC) : “A combination of circumstances, effects, or specific key \nevent, critical factor, or function that when realised allows commanders to gain a marked \nadvantage over an opponent or contribute materially to achieving an operational objective.” \n (AA P-06) \n•Planning Concept, normally only used at the strategic & operational level.\nThe UK  and NATO  tends to only use Decisive Conditions in its operational -level \nplanning.   \nThe USA can refer to Decisive Points  in National Planning – see JP -5. It is a similar \nconcept . (Do not confuse with Decision Po ints at para 1.71 later )  \n1.33.  What is a Decisive Condition? Decisive conditions (DC) are campaign building \nblocks. They are essential for the achievement of operational objectives and, by inference, \nthe operational end -state. They are derived from analysis of the Op end- state , or relevant \nfactor s & centre(s) of gravity  analysis  and then later refined during the estimate process. \nThey are achieved by realising operational effects (OE); operational actions  (OA) are \nconducted to create these effects.  DC should be written in a way that helps make it clear when they have been achieved.  At the same time that you identify decisive conditions, you should also plan how to assess progress towards them  using Measures of Effectiveness \n(MOE). \n1.34.  Determining Decisive Conditions :  DCs are normally created as the result of \nanalysis in Step 1 and Step 2 of the estimate process.  They may be altered or changed \nduring planning ‘ refine’ or as a result of the assessment process , or a change in the \nsituation.  \n1.35.  How  to write Decisive conditions. One way to approach writing DCs is to think of \nthem as the desired condition(s) (or state) of a system or system element that we wish to \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 exist at some point in the future, which we believe will be ‘decisive’ to the achievement of \none or more of the operational objectives.  \n•In planning, we would express these desired ‘decisive’ conditions using words\nexpressing - how we would wish to see them at that future time - to show that they are\nsomething to be established or achieved. Examples:\noControl of the Air  in the Joint Operations Area (JOA) ESTABLISHED.\noSea in the Olive Strait and the Purple Sea CONTROL LED.\noLand LOC SECURED.\noOperational Airports of Debarkation (APODs)/Seaports of Debarkation (SPODs)\nESTABLISHED.\noSOUTHLAND Government authority re -ESTABLISHED.\n1.36.  Effects : “Effects are recognizable changes in the behavioural  or physical state of a \nsystem that result from one or more actions .” \n  ( AJP-5 Definition Para 3.13 ) \n•Types: Strategic Effects (SE) Operational- level Effects (OE)  and Tactical Effects  (E).\nThe UK Does not commonly use the term Strategic Effects in its operations \nplanning lexicon and staff work except, occasionally, in the CDS planning \ndirective as a narrative descriptor.  \nNATO use the term Strategic Effects as a formal part of their planning and staff \nwork, the NID and SACEUR Directive will always list the strategic effects needed \nto achieve the strategic objectives and end -state.  \n1.37.  Strategic Effects : “These describe specific changes required in the capabilities, \nactions and behaviour of specific actors required to achieve the strategic objectives and \ndirectly influence succ ess and the termination of operations.” \n1.38. Operational Effects (OE):  Are “the changes in systems/sy stems elements  to \nestablish the operational conditions necessary to establis h DCs and achieve the \noperational objectives ,”      (COPD 4.27.f)   \n1.39. Tactical Effects (E): “A change which is a result or consequence of an action or \nother cause.” (ADP Land Operations Glossary  & AFM Command para 6-1 8). \nF\nigure1. 7 Showing the relationship between decisive conditions & operational effects  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 11 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.40.  How to write Operational Effects :  Derived from objectives, operational effects \n(OE) bridge the gap between Decisive Conditions (DC) and the tactical activity of \nOperational Actions (OA) by describing what changes in a system.  Effects are written to: \n•Express one idea in simple language, without adverbs.\n•Identify who or what must be affected or changed (e.g. what system elements and/or\nrelationships in the system need to change) and the desired resultant state.\n•Not suggest ways, solutions or means, or infer causality. The effect does not descri be\nw\nho will act to make the desired change, the means to be used or if those means will  be\nl\nethal or non -lethal.  This detail will be considered in the Joint Action process .\n•Be measurable and achievable. Changes in behaviour or system attributes must be abl e\nt\no be observed. Effects should also avoid being overly simplistic, idealistic or optimistic.\n•Examples:\noRedland capital SEIZED .\noTerritorial airspace control measure ESTABLISHED .\noRedland ports BLOCKADED .\nFi\ngure1. 8 The relationship and logic between DCs and OEs is clearly shown in this DC/OE \nTable planning tool used in the operational- level estimate  (AJP- 5 Annex E).  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 12 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.41.  Action: “the fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim / a \nthing done; an act”  (Oxford English Dictionary)   \nActions: Can also be thought of as the process of engaging any instrument at an \nappropriate level in the engagement space in order to create (a) specific effect(s).\n( COPD Glossary of Terms)  \n•Actions are carried out at all levels.  The Words ‘ Actions ’ and ‘Activities ’ are us ed\ni\nnterchangeably in doctrine.\n•In doctrinal terms ‘actions’ are the planning building blocks that create  ‘effects’ .\nN\nATO uses the term at the strategic level as a formal part of planning; hence \nstrategic actions achieve strategic effects.  The COPD also talks about \nOperational Actions to achieve operational effects.  \nIn the UK, Operational Actions (OA) comprise of tactical military activities that are \norchestrated through joint action to achieve operational effects (OE).   \n1.42.  Tactical Actions ( Ac): “Action : A task performed by land forces to create a particular \neffect” (ADP Land Ops) . In UK Doctrine Tactical Activities were formerly described as \ntactical actions.  (ADP Land Ops)  There are four groups of tactical activities – offensive, \ndefensive, stability and enabling.  \n1.43.  Operational Actions ( OA):  Actions will be identified through the estimate process \nand should be noted.  They will need to be formally aligned to achieve operational effects  \nusing the joint action process, initially during step 4, but in much greater detail during the \n‘refine’ joint action process after a COA has been selected in step 6.  \n1.44.  Joint Action Table .  The relationship and logic between DCs , OEs and Actions is \nclearly shown in this planning tool  used in the operational- level estimate : \nFigure 1.9 Example Joint Action Table  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 13 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.45.  The Relationship Between Planning Concepts: \nThe ‘layered’ relationship between the planning concepts: End state/Outcomes – Objectives \n–(Decisive Conditions) - Effects – Actions, with definitions, is depicted below.

Line of Operation  (LoO) : “A path linking decisive conditions to achieve an\nobjective.   (AAP -06)\n•Normally only used in Strategic & Operational- level planning.\n1.47.  Lines of Operation :  A line of operation (LoO) links decisive conditions to achieve an\nobjective. Along any LoO it will be necessary to determine the sequence of actions, effects\nand conditions required to achieve the objectives.  LoO are used to arrange operations in\ntime, space and purpose to transform specific unacceptable conditions at the start of theoperation to conditions required to achieve operational and strategic objectives.\n(AJP- 5 Para 3.15 )\nFigure 1. 11 Showing Lines of operation as part of an operations framework schematic  \n1.48.  What  Types of Line of Operation (Lo O) Can I Use?  The determination of LoOs\nwill shape the development of the plan as well as the conduct of operations. Functionallycross- cutting LoOs, each involving more than one element of power, will create a more\neffective system for coordination between partners during planning and execution. This typeof LoO construct brings to bear the capabilities of multiple elements of power, which makes it\nparticularly effective toward achieving more complex objectives or outcomes. The choice of\nLoO will depend on the type and number of Decisive Conditions.  Lines of operation should\nnormally be directed towards the achievement of an operational objective and may or may\nnot pass through the Centre of Gravity, as shown above.  Options for Lo O include:\n•Domain: eg maritime, land, air.\n•Functional: eg manoeuvre, fires, CIMIC.\n•Thematic: eg education, security, governance.\n•Functional Framework: eg operational framework:  s hape, engage, ex ploit, protect &\nsustain.Opera�ons Framework Schema�c\n(MILITARY ) STRATEGIC\nOBJECTIVES & END-STATE\nLine of \nOperation 2\nLine of \nOperation 1\nLine of \nOperation 3\nLine of \nOperation 4\nRED\nOperational\nCentre of \nGravityPhase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3\nOwn\nOperational\nCentre of\nGravity\nOwn CVs\n1.\n2.\n3.\n Operational End -State\nDC 1\nDC 4\nDC 3\nDC 8\nDC 2\nDC 6\nDC 5\nDC 7\n DC 9\nDC 10\n DC 12\nBranch\nSequel\nC1  Control of the Air ACHIEVED\nC2  RED C 2 NEUTRALISED\nC3  Own Capability DEMONSTRATED\nC4  RED Navy Ports BLOCKADED\nC5  RED Navy DISPERSED\nC6  RED Diplomatically ISOLATED\nDC7  RED Land Forces ISOLATED\nDC8  RED Garrison DEFEATED\nDC9  Own forces Deployed\nDC10  BLUE Government RESTORED\nDC11  Secure Blueland Borders\nDC12  Peace treaty Signed\nOperational\nObjective\nOperational\nObjective\nOperational\nObjective\nDC 11DP\nDP\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 15 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.49.  Culmination : “The point in time and the location at which a force no longer has the \ncapability to continue an operation under current conditions .”  (AAP- 06) \n1.50.  Why do Forces Culminate?  A military force will culminate for one or more of the \nfollowing reasons:  \n•Higher than anticipated attrition or activity – ie not enough combat power remaining.\n•Inadequate logistics – ie running out of fuel or ammunition.\n•Extended lines of communication – slowing down the rate of logistic support.\n•Poor or inadequate intelligence leading to an unrealistic estimation of the enemy’s or\none’s own forces relative capabilities.\n•In the offence, the attacking force reaches its culminating point when it can no longer\nsustain its offensive action and must transition to the defence or risk counterattack  and\ndefeat.\n•In the defence, the defending force reaches its culminating point when it no longer hasthe capability to mount a counter offensive or defend successfully and is forced t\no\ndi\nsengage or withdraw or face defeat.\n1.51.  How do you Plan to Avoid Culmination?  Planners should use sequencing and \nphasing in their own planning to ensure that operations by opposing actors culminate well \nbefore they can achieve their objective while ensuring that their own operations achieve their \nobjectives well before any culmination.       \n1.52.  Operational Pause : “A temporary and deliberate cessation of certain activities \nduring the course of an operation to avoid reaching the culminating point and to be able to \nregenerate the combat power required to proceed with the next stage of the operation.”  \n   (AAP6 Definition)  \n1.53.  How do I use a ‘Operational Pause’ in my Plan?  Although a pause tends to \nreduce tempo, at least in the short term, it can also provide greater effectiveness and improved tempo later on. Indeed, implicit in the term ‘pause’ is the ability to re- activate the \noperation in order to regain the initiative and re- establish momentum.  An operational pause \ncan apply to all component activity  or to just one line of operation or one component of the \nforce , for example to concentrate effort on another.   \n1.54.  Pause - Don’t Culminate!   A planned operational pause is preferable to premature \nculmination.  Nevertheless, operational -level planners need to ensure an integrated \napproach to the operational design in order to minimise the requirement for operational \npauses in the operation. (A JP-5 Para 3.17)  \n1.55.  Sequencing and Phases (AJP -5 para 3.18)  The primary aim in sequencing and \nphasing an operation or campaign is to maintain its continuity and tempo and to avoid \nunnecessary operational pauses. \n1.56.  Sequencing: “Sequencing is the arrangement, simultaneously or sequentially, of \nactions designed to create effects to establish DCs within a campaign or operation in an \norder that is most likely to produce the desired operational outcomes.” \n(COPD Para 4.27.j.(1))  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 16 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025  \n1.57.  Why do we Sequence in Planning?  The planning team  should determine the best \narrangement of actions and effects to achieve objectives. This arrangement will often be a \ncombination of simultaneous  and sequential  actions. However, it may not be possible to \nachieve the objectives in a single engagement or even a major operation. As such, the operations design normally provides for the sequencing of actions and the phasing of operations. Although simultaneous action on multiple lines of operation may be ideal, \nresource availability usually forces the commander to prioritize  and sequence the actions; \nconsequently, a commander may choose to sequence the actions in order to reduce risks to \nan acceptable level. This process assists in thinking through the entire operation logically in \nterms of available forces, resources and time, and helps to determine different operational phases.  \n1.58.  Phases: “A clearly defined stage of an operation or campaign during which the main \nforces and capabilities employed set conditions for a common purpose.”  (COPD Glossary of \nTerms)  \n1.59.  What is Phasing?  \nPhasing is a way to view and \nconduct a complex joint operation \nin manageable parts.  Phases \nrepresent distinct stages in the \nprogress of the overall operation. Phases are sequential but the \ncourse of effects and actions\n may \noverlap. The actions required to create certain effects in a certain \nphase, may well start prior to the phase in question.   The \ncommander may designate a main effort in each phase. \n•Each phase should have a set\nof starting conditions (thatdefine the start of the phase)\nand ending conditions (that\ndefine the end of the phase).\n•The ending conditions of\n one\nphas\ne are the starti ng\nc\nonditions for the next phase.\n1.60.  What should I call the Phases?  Phases can be numbered or given a name that \nreflects the predominate purpose of the activity taking place in the phase.  Often this may be \nbased on a d octrinal activity framework  for the type of operation or activity . \nFigure 1.13 Showing notional phases of a campaign  Figure 1.12 Sequencing – arrangement of DC, Effects & Actions, simultaneously or sequentially.  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 17 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.61.  Synchronization, synergy and leverage .  The planning team  “considers how to \nbest synchronize actions in order to generate the greatest effect with a given expenditure of \nresources or a desired effect with the least expenditure”. ( AJP- 5 para  3.18.b) \n1.62.  Synchronisation. Synchronization is the arrangement of actions and their effects in \ntime, space and purpose. The planning team  will therefore make integrated use of all \ncapabilities available to them  to achieve their objective. The primary benefit from \nsynchronized actions is the ability to produce synergy using different resources and gain \nleverage through creating effects and their exploitation throughout the operations area.  \n1.\n63. Synergy.  Synergy is the ultimate aim of all synchronization efforts. Synergy is the \ncumulative outcome or result of discrete acts; it is greater than the sum of the individual parts acting independently. Synergy should be the result of effective synchronization. In  \npractice, it means integration and synchronization of actions aimed to achieve the objective.  \n1.64.  Leverage.  Leverage is achieved when the resulting impact of an action is more than \nproportionate to the effort applied. Leverage can be achieved by focusing the joint force’s  \nstrengths, against another actor’s weaknesses and  utilizing also other instruments of power \nin a comprehensive approach. \n1.65.  What’s the Difference between Sequence & Synchronise in Planning?  \nSequencing is the logical arrangement of effects and activities based on their \ninterdependencies.  Synchronisation applies time , space and resource considerations to \nsequences and thus establishes their feasibility. \n1.66.  How do I Sequence & Synchronise in Planning ? Broad Guidance is: \n•Decisive Conditions (DCs) are sequenced in the order they need to be achieved.\nReflected in their position on the different LoO in the Operational framework.\nFigure 1.14 Tactical  Land  Synchronisation Matrix  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 18 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Operational Effects (OEs) are sequenced and may be  synchronised in time, space and\npurpose against Resources in COA development.

Reflected in the tactical missions (list\nof tasks with a purpose) and tactical Synchronisation Matrix.\n1.67.  Simultaneity and depth . The planning team determines the extent to which joint \nforces can conduct simultaneous actions  to create Effects & DCs throughout the depth of the \noperations area. \n•This is largely a function of the availability of military resources and their operational\nreach. The intent should always be to achieve synergy by combining the effects ofsimultaneous actions to overwhelm the adversary’s ability to respond effectively with s\no\nm\nany actions occurring at one time and to conceal the direction of main effort as long as\npossible . (AJP-5 para 3.18.c )\n1.68.  Tempo .  Tempo is the rate or rhythm of activity relative to the adversary’s, within \ntactical actions and between major operations. \n•Tempo incorporates the capacity of a joint force to make the transition from oneoperational posture to another to gain and maintain the initiative. The ability to dictate t\nhe\noper\national tempo provides freedom of action and is key to bringing an adversary  to its\nculmination point while preventing the premature culmination of one’s own operation.\n(AJP- 5 para 3.18. d)\n1.69.   Branches and Sequels - Contingency Options Planning .  An essential step in the \noperations design process in operational- level planning is to anticipate eventualities that may \noccur during the course of an operation and determine alternative LoOs and sequences of  \naction, while still achieving the objective.  \n•For every action there is a range of possible outcomes that may or may not create t he\ndesired effects or the expected changes of conditions.\n•Outcomes that are more favourable than expected may present opportunities that c an be\nexploited.\n•Outcomes that are worse than expected may pose risks that can be mitigated.\n•The commander and the planning team  must anticipate possible good and bad outcomes\nand link them to decision points and develop options for dealing with them.\n•This is achieved by developing branches  and sequels  derived from continuously exposin g\nthe operations design to questions, concerning situations that could possibly occur duri ng\neach phase of the operation.

Branches are \noptions within a particular \nphase of a joint \noperation, which are planned and conducted in response to an \nanticipated opportunity or \nrisk within that phase, to \nprovide the flexibility to \nretain the initiative and ultimately achieve the \noriginal objective. \nBranches address the \nquestion of “ what if ”?  \n•When Used?  I\nn\nr\nesponse to anticipated \nopportunity or reversal within that phase. \n•Scale: Smaller.\n•How :  Same decisive condition, different operational effects and actions.  Normally a\nJ3/5 task  and initiated through a FRAGO to change the existing  Joint Coordination Order\nor Operation Order .\n1.71.  What is a Sequel?  \nSequels are options for \nsubsequent operations \nwithin an operation or the \nfollowing phase(s) of an \noperation. Sequels \naddress the question of “what’s next?”  \n•When Used?  They\nare planned on the\nbasis of the likely\noutcome of the current\noperation or phase  t\no\npr\novide the flexibility t o\nr\netain the initiative and/or\nenhance operational tempo.\n•Scale: Normally larger.\n•How :  different DCs, so  also different operational effects and actions. Normally J5 lead\nand initiated through a new Joint Coordination Order or Operation Order.\n1.72.  Decision Points (DP). Decision points are events defined in time or space on which \nthe commander is expected to have to make a decision to ensure timely execution and \nsynchronization of resources.  Decision points can be linked to assumptions and \ncommander’s critical information requirements,  and they should lead to the requirement for \nbranches and sequels.  \nFigure 1. 15 Illustrating a DP & Branch in an Op Framework Schematic  \nFigure 1. 16 Illustrating a DP & Sequel in an Op Framework Schematic  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 20 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.73.

Operational Timeline (Also called Mission Timeline). The operational timeline (see \nFig 3.1) a llows  staff t o understand t he se quencing of m ilitary ac tivity.  The operational \ntimeline will reflect  all of t he know n and assu med timings,  both enemy and friendly,  that \nrelate to t he operation’s execution (no move before, preparatory movement, H -hour, D- Day, \nobjective  clear by,  etc.). These times can i nitially be drawn directly from t he higher \ncommander’s orders  and w ill be refined as  the estimate progresses.   \n3.\n3. Staff Planning T imeline . The Staff timeline is dictated by the events within the \noperational timeline, and it determines the proportions of time that will be allocated for the \nestimate  process. Planning will start when the time higher commander’s orders  were  \nreceived and finish when the orders are delivered. It should be noted that the staff planning \ntimeline can be refined continuously . \n3.4. Determi nimg the Staff  Planning Timeline.  To calculate the time available for \nplanning we first need to determine when all planning must be complete (planning deadline) \nFigure 3. 1 Illustrating an operational timeline  \nSERIAL 3-01-03 \n3–01–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 3– May 2022 \nfor both our own HQ  and our subordinates. This includes distribution and briefing of those \norders .  The COS will decide this  time, in consultation with the Commander.   The \nmechanism we use is known as the ‘One Third Two Thirds Rule’  (See Fig 3. 2). This means \nthat, as a general rule, we give ourselves one third of whatever time is available to complete \nour planning and orders, and our subordinates collectively have two- thirds of the remaining \ntime for their planning and orders.   The HQ staff normally break -up their 1/3 as shown in Fig \n3.3. and that proportions of time within the staff 1/3 are adjusted to meet the requirement of \nthe type of estimate being conducted.  \nFigure 3. 2 Illustrating the 1/3 – 2/3 planning time allocation rule  \nFigure 3.3 Illustrating how the ‘planning 1/3’ is allocated to steps of the estimate process  \nSERIAL 3-01-04\n3–01–04 - 1\nOr\niginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023END STATE AND OBJECTIVE (D-I-M-E ) ANALYSIS\n4.1.

IPE is  the Land Tactical \nLevel process that is also occasionally called IPB – Intelligence Preparation of the \nBattlefield.   \nJOINT INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE OPERAT ING ENVIRONMENT (JIPOE)  \n5.1. What is JIPOE  ?  The JIPOE process is a disciplined analytical methodology \nconducted by the intelligence staff that produces intelligence assessments, estimates and \nother intelligence products to support operations planning.  JIPOE is a three- stage process \nthat conducts operational area evaluation, threat evaluation and threat integration.   It \nshould:  \n•Define the operating environment.\n•Describe the environment’s effects on the conduct of operations.\n•Analyse the actors or intended targets.\n•Identify possible risks to operations.\n•Identify areas where intelligence collection assets must monitor o r detect threats or\nassess progress.\n•Identify opportunities where friendly forces can influence events or opinions thr ough\nl\nethal or non -lethal means.\n•Identify decision points when the commander must act to influence the outcome of\nthe operation.\n•Analyse the commander’s and adversary’s centres of gravity.\nJOINT INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE \nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT (JIPOE)  \nArea Evaluation Threat Evaluation Threat Integration \nPhysical Terrain \nAnalysis  Adversary Analysis Adversary aims & \nobjectives  \nA ctor Analysis Adversary COAs \nNote:  JIPOE does not include  Information Environment Analysis – this is a separate process \nat the operational -level. At the Tactical level information environment analysis is included in  \noperational area evaluation if required.

What is IPE?   Full Intelligence Preparation o f The Environment  is a tactical level \nplanning tool designed to analyse both the physical , information and human terrain as well \nas the enemy and adversary in order to establish what the enemy is most likely to do and \nwhen. It consists of:  \n• Operational Area Evaluation (OAE)  \n• Threat Evaluation (TE).  \n• Threat  Integration ( TI). \n \n \nFigure 5. 2 Illustrating an overview of IPE processes . \n5.3. Operational  Area Evaluation  (OAE) .  OAE is the analysis of the terrain, people and \nthe effects of the weather in order to identify how the environment impacts on the movement \nand actions of both friendly forces and actors, audiences, adversaries and  the enemy.  \nIncludes:  \n• Physical Environment Analysis . (Terrain & Weather)  \n• Information Environment Analysis. (See Serial 4 -02-05) \n• Human Network Analysis.  \n5.4. Threat Evaluation (TE). TE is the doctrinal and strength analysis of the enemy to \nidentify the tactics that are most likely to be used.  \n5.5. Threat  Integration (TI). TI is the analysis of the enemy overlaid onto the \nenvironment to identify how the enemy’s tactics will be applied in the environment.  From this, \nthe most likely  (ML) and most dangerous (MD) enemy Course of Action (COA) can be \nassessed.  \nNote  Human Terrain Analysis \nmay be omitted if it is clear that \nthe population has no bearing on the operation.

Human Network  Analysis .  Today’s operational environment is complex. The \noperational environment may have conventional forces, irregular fighters or criminal armed \ngroups all operating in the same geographic area. The human factor is always present in \nthese groups and their networks must be assessed.  Networks vary, including by: location; \nsize; shape; membership; demographics; risks and motivations. Successful networks are well integrated into their operating environment, and are commensurately challenging to locate and track, and thus hard to engage. \n5.7. Network Associations . Networks form because of common outcomes or \nallegiances. Examples of these allegiances our shared goals are below:  \n•Political motivated network.\n•Military network.\n•Economically motivated networks.\n•Social/Cultural Network.\n•Infrastructure (Proximity / Organizational) network.\n•Family Network.\n•Specialized or Functional network.\n5.8. Threat Network Organizational Structures. Networks can be organized in a variety \nof ways. Many will deviate from the hierarchical structures familiar to conventional forces.   \nFigure 5. 3 Illustrating Network organisational structures.  \n5.9. Macro Analysis of Networks .  Macro analysis supports strategic and operational \nlevel planning. It helps to develop a network profile and identifies the networks that pose the \ngreatest threat to success in the operational environment. Networks are created by \nindividuals and their nodes and links. Macro analysis concentrates upon a broad overarching understanding of the networks and identifies threat network critical capabilities and \nobjectives, operational areas, activities and requirements. Centre of Gravity (C oG) analysis \n\nSERIAL 3-01-05 \n3–01–05 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 helps to identify critical vulnerabilities. Macro analysis tools include the PMESII -ASCOPE \nframework, that provides an appropriate level of specificity to guide initial collection. \nFigure 5. 4 Illustrating a PMESII -ASCOPE framework . (See Serial 3 -01-06) \n5.10.  Micro  Analysis of Networks.   Once the initial macro analysis has identified \nnetwork critical capabilities and objectives, operational areas, activities and \nrequirements, the staff and supporting analysts can then produce micro network data by \nleveraging all source information (to include information derived from the exploitation of \nadversary activities).  \n5.11.  Threat Network analytical methods .  There \nare several different analytical methods to study \nnetworks at the micro level. Or the sake of brevity the \nMAJCSC focuses on three methodologies.  \n•Association Matrix . The Association matrix\nis useful to organize relationship data and\ncharacterize the links that exist (or are\nsuspected to exist) among nodes.\n•Activities Matrix.  The activities\nmatrix identifies the associati on\nbetween individuals and specific\nactivities and shows the relationshi p\nbetween them.\nFigure 5. 5 Illustrating a n Association Matrix . \nFigure 5. 6 Illustrating \nan Activities  Matrix  \nSERIAL 3-01-05 \n3–01–05 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Link analysis . Analysts use the\nlink diagrams to graphically\ndisplay the strengths and the\nweaknesses of the relationshipsbetween the nodes in networks.The link diagram format is theorganization of symbols \nand\nr\nules. It displays known  and\ns\nuspected linkages.\n  \n5.\n12. IPE – STAGE 2 - Threat Evaluation  is the identification, evaluation and analysis of \nthe spread of adversaries and enemies. It involves an assessment of an enemy’s capacity to \nconduct  operations and, from considering their doctrine or modus operandi (MO), the tactics \nwhich are likely to be used in oper ations against friendly forces.  It assesses the enemy’s \nlikely objectives  within the AO. The result of the Threat Evaluation can be an overlay or a \nseries of overlays  showing deployment and tactics for each doctrinal COA. Gaps in our \nknowledge will subsequently  become IRs. It has 3 parts , as highlighted below:  \nFigure 5. 7 Illustrating \na Link Analysis.  \nSERIAL 3-01-05 \n3–01–05 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 5.13.  IPE – Stage 3 - Threat  Integration .  Threat Integration fuses the results of the \nOperational Area Evaluation and Threat Evaluation. It identif ies how the operating \nenvironment will shape an enemy’s or adversary’s capabilities, doctrine and tactics and \neffectively turn it into practice,  the Event Overlay, identifying enemy  potential COAs ( the ML \nand MD) and/or the civilian population’s COAs. A n Event Overlay is produced at the e nd of \nStep 2 of the 7 Step Estimate. The Event Overlay is then taken forward by the COA teams, \nwhere a separate DSO  is created for each COA during Steps 3 and 4.    \nIPE Stage 3 – Threat Integration \nMAJCSC: Note  for DSO  \n•NAIs identified in Steps 1 & 2.\n•TAIs & DPs developed for\neach COA in Step 3 & 4.\n•Each COA should have a\ndi\nfferent Draft DSO  \n Within Steps 3 &  4\nof 7 Step Estimate  Within Steps 1 & 2 \nof 7 Step Estimate  \n3–01–05 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 SERIAL 3-01-05 \n5.14.

Likewise, a DSOM should be supported by a Decision Support Matrix (DSM), a table that  summarises \nall the DPs, related CCIRs and indicators and the conditions for subsequent/linked actions.  \n• Initial Draft  DSO: This will first be produced during DMMP step one and two  as an output of the Situation Integration activity of Intelligence Preparation \nof the Environment (IPE).

This could include obvious \nEffects or Actions identified in Step 2 analysis.  \n• Refine Draft DSO : In Step 3 the COA team(s) should begin by reflecting the \nComd’s guidance & overlaying the commander’s effects onto the map and in the \nprocess refine the draft DSO from steps 1 & 2, considering the commander’s ME \nfirst.  The next step is the refinement of NAIs / TAI s to more accurately predict \nwhere each effect / action needs to be achieved. Once this is complete, COA teams(s) should identify the requirement for DPs that support the NAIs and TAIs, \nand the DPs must then be mapped to the CCIRs and recorded on the DSOM and \nDSM. Finally, the COA team(s) must record the location and purpose of each \nNAI/TAI and DP/DL on the draft DSOM:   \no Decision Point (DP)/Decision Line (DL):  A point or line in time or space \nwhere a commander must make a decision to influence the operation.

Understanding .  This  is one of the cornerstones of our military philosophy and it is \nimplicit in applying the tenets of doctrine. Fighting power cannot be applied effectively and \nefficiently without understanding: the competition and its context; the operating environment; our own capabilities; and the capabilities of audiences. Understanding helps commanders to make decisions; it also helps them to manage any associated risks and any second and \nsubsequent order effects that could be harmful in influencing the targeted audienc es. \n6.2. What is Analysis?   Analysis is the process of evaluating information about the \ncurrent and past behaviour of a state, system, organisation or individual. Thus, analysis is an \nessential component in the process of converting situational awareness into understanding . \n6.3. Analysis Frameworks .  Selection of a problem  solving framework must focus on \nwhether it provides the necessary degree of granularity to meet a specific situation.  Examples include: \n•PEST  – Political, Economic, Social and Technological.\n•PESTLEI  – Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental & Info\n•PMESII  -PT– Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure and Information –\nPhysical, Time .  This is a widely used and effective U.S. model.\n•STEEPLEM  – Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, Ethical\nand Military.\n•ASCOPE – Area, Structure, Capabilities, Organisation, People and Events (used by the\nUS and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan).\n•Human Terrain .  Understanding the human terrain requires us to understand the local\npopulation’s environment from their perspective .\n6.4. The \ndevelopment of understanding .  In \na crisis, our initial understanding could \nbe limited.  We are \nlikely to know the approximate nature of the situation, timeframe and hav\ne\na br\noad idea of the \ninformation sources we will need to access ( Box A ). We \nwill develop and build on that initial \nunderstanding by defining more accurately the requirement for further knowledge, es\ntablishing suitable networks (human and electronic) and selecting the most effective \nanalytical tool ( Box B ). Analysis allows us to construct a more accurate perspective of the \nhuman domain and to enhance our understanding of how the separate environments interact with one another. This allows us to identify whom we can or cannot influence and how best to apply  the levers of  national power and plan to achieve our desired end -state  (Box C ).

Analysis of the Human Terrain . It is important to examine  all aspects of the human terrain, and to avoid only focusing on the obvious \nand different aspects of audiences . Cultural practices are the things that are immediately observable in a society, such as people’s style of \ndress, greetings  and rituals, flags and other symbols. On an individual level, cultural practices  manifest themselves in a person’s behaviour.   \nHowever, to understand the human terrain, we need to look beyond the immediately observable cultural  practices  to examine what drives or \nunderlies these practices. These social  structures are the normally invisible concepts and institutions that organise society.  \n6.9. The Human Terrain Model .  To help simplify complexity we tend to create defined categories and structures  for analysis .  There is a \ndanger that these divisions are artificial and mask  the subtle interconnected nature of human society and social interaction.  \n6.10.  Categories of Analysis.   The following categories of analysis are not absolute, the context and operating environment may require \nadditional areas to be considered.  \n• Social Organisation .  Social organisation is  the basic building block of society. It includes the groups into which people are born, and \nwhich influence their attitudes and behaviour throughout their life.  On a larger scale, a person shares a language, history and usually \nreligion with his ethnic group. Gender is also part of social organisation, as men and women usually have different roles and  \nresponsibilities in a society.  \n• Political Organisation. Power and politics work in different ways in different societies.  Successful engagement with people in power \nrelies on understanding why the people around them follow their directions. Understanding the nature of political organisation in the society \nis essential in determining who actually holds the power and their influences  within different audiences . \n• Economic Organisation. Access to resources underpins behaviours and attitudes of all people. How resources are distributed and \nexchanged differs according to the type of audience.  \n• Beliefs and Values.  S hared beliefs and values ensure the loyalty  and shapes the behaviour  of members to a n audience group. These \nmay include formal  ideologies or religions  or informal or non- codified beliefs about the nature of the world and of society .  Understanding \nthese values helps commanders anticipate the likely  behaviour of the  audience group.  \n• Interaction . All audience groups have normal ways for their members to interact  with each other, ranging from the language that they \nshare, through their  concepts of personal space, hand gestures and clothing. Differences in interaction styles are often the most obvious \naspect of the human terrain.   Understanding local norms and practices in interacting with others is essential for mission success . \n6.11.  Human Terrain in Military Physical Domains . The aspects of the human terrain described above apply to people wherever they live. \nFor. It is therefore essential that intelligence staff  examine the people in the joint operational environment from the perspective of the people, \nrather than from the perspective of the military environment in which they are placed.   \nSERIAL 3-01-07 \n3–01–07 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 EFFECTS SCHEMATICS \n7.1.

What is a Synchronisation Matrix?  A Synchronisation ( Synch ) Matrix is an outline \nof the sequence of actions by tactical grouping against an operational timeline.  Importantly, \nit is a visual tool with which to illustrate the sequencing, in time and space, of manoeuvre, \nfires, information, CIMIC  and expected enemy activities. It is typically represented on a bar \ngraph with force elements along the Y axis and time along the X axis.   The content and \nlayout are flexible.  synchronization matrices may quickly become too large to manage as a \nsingle product and may need to be broken down, such as by phase, line of operation or \nactor , to maintain utility.  \n8.2.

Factor Analysis  & ‘Three Column Format’ (3CF) :  The 3CF is a basic but highly \neffective analytical tool used at all stages of the estimate, though it is particularly applicable \nduring Mission Analysis.  It is a mechanism that helps a commander and staff to interrogate \nthe factors within a problem, and to record that analysis through deductions to a series of outputs.  It therefore provides an audit trail of the logic upon which a plan is based. The \noutput from the 3CF is a series of staff tasks or constraints, using a commonly understood \nStaff  Planning Lexicon (See Serial 3 -01-02).   \n \nFigure 9. 1 The 3 Column Analysis Method  \n \nFigure 9. 2 The ‘Big 5’ Factors that must be analysed, individually & relative to each other : showing outputs  \n9.2. What Factors to analyse?  All key factors that have a bearing on the mission and \nactivities in the Area of Operations should be analysed.  This is done using the 3CF , or other \nsuitable analytical method. Results should be summarised and presented at the Mission \nAnalysis Brief.  At a minimum, the ‘big 5 ” topics shown above must be evaluated, both \nindividually and relative to each other.

Understanding  Risk  & Opportunity.   All operations require commanders at all \nlevels to identify and seize opportunities.  But they also necessarily involve significant and \noften fatal risks. Understanding risk , and its implications  at the different levels of operations  \nis essential  for commanders and staff .   \n10.2.  Military Risk (AAP -6 Definition ): “Risk states the extent to which uncertainties and \npotential events  might have an impact on the achievement of objectives.”  \n10.3.  Military Risk Management  (AAP -6 Definition) : “The process of Identifying, \nassessing and controlling risk arising from operational factors, and making informed \ndecisions that balance risk cost with mission benefits.  \n10.4.  Strategic Risk:  Events that impact upon or change the overall strategic context \nmay, in extremis, jeopardise the achievement of strategic outcomes. e g:  A change of \ngovernment or its policy . \n10.5.  Operational  Risk: Risks to the mission and \nrisks to the force through poor planning or  execution \nand through external influence ie enemy activity.  \n10.6.  Operating  Risk :  Relates to the potential \nnegative outcomes born out of operating technical \nmilitary capabilities.  ie aircraft operating out of normal \ntolerances for temperature.  \n10.7.  Tactical  Risk :  This arises from the effects of both planned or anticipated activity and \nthe results of entirely unforeseen or planned activity –  events of chance.  \n10.8.  The Implications of R isk.  Risk has different implications at different levels of \noperations with actions and decisions taken at one level potentially incurring risk at another.   \n \nFigure 10. 2 Showing the decision tree for the consequences of risk  \n10.9.  Risk in Planning.  Ultimately the commander of any force, supported where \napplicable by  the staff, is responsible for judging and accepting risk. Superior headquarters \nwill support this task  by communicating their risk analysis and any  corresponding \nmanagement plans in OSW.

In  addition, commanders will identify additional risks during  \ntheir own Missio n Analysis; particularly at question 4,  when they consider ‘how might the \nsituation change’. The commander and staff will also identify  and consider risks during the \nrest of the estimate.   This should involve understanding potential causes,  likelihood and \nimpact in the context of the operation.  \n10.10.  Risk in Execution.  Risk will already have been identified and planned for during the \nestimate process but there will inevitably be risks which have not been anticipated.  Where \nthese represent a significant risk to the mission or force they will be managed through \nreactiv e planning or direction as part of the HQ battle rhythm and assessment process.   \n10.11.  Risk  Appetite . Military commanders have always \npractised risk management in military decision making, \nbut their appetite for risk and their approach to it may \nvary widely depending on their level of training and \nexperience.  Recognising the factors that affect his own and others’ perceptions of risk (high HQs and \nmultinational partners) is an important aspect of a \nCommander’s leadership. The perceived level of risk is \noften related to potential losses and gains, and a commander should apply his judgement to weigh, in so  \nfar as is possible, the estimated cost against the potential benefits with regards to achievement of the end -\nstate.  The right attitude of mind is important; one that sees risks not only as threats, but also as potential opportunities to be exploited. Risk analysis and management  supports the \ntaking of calculated risks, rather than gambles, while avoiding unduly cautious decision-making, and missed opportunities.  \n10.12.

Risk Assessment  seeks to \nunderstand the likelihood of the \nevent occurring, the potential \nseverity of the outcome (its \nimpact), and who owns the risk. \nWhilst risks have to be analysed individually, the compound effect \nof multiple and linked risks and \ntheir consequences at  different \nlevels, also require consideration. There are a number of techniques and methods, using subjective and \nobjective data, to assess the \nlikelihood and impact of every risk. \nIt is the combination of the impact \nand the likelihood which is \nimportant as it will give the overall significance of that activity or event occurring.  It should be noted that the \nimpact of a risk occurring is a subjective judgement which will change as the context and perceptions change. Commanders may then articulate their risk tolerance level. Attributing \nweighting / importance to each risk assists the prioritisation of mitigation / reduction \nmeasures and aids the development of CONPLANS. A method of displaying risk graphically is shown at here  in figure 10.5.  \n10.\n14. Plan ed R esponse options are not necessarily mutually exclusive or appropriate in \nall circumstances. The options can include the following:   \n•Terminate. Termination removes the risk entirely by changing the plan,  so the risk i s\nel\niminated, or terminating that aspect of the plan which is affected by the risk.\n•Treat . Treating a risk to reduce its likelihood, or mitigate likely adverse outcomes to\nreduce impact, is the most common response. Commanders should consider how\nFigure 10. 5 A Risk Matrix showing example risk treatment\napproaches  \nFigure 10. 6 Four separate risk matrices combined into one to display different categories \nof risk.  All have the high – high axis orientated to the centre.  \nSERIAL 3-01- 10 \n3–01– 10 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 activity might be conducted differently in order to reduce the threat. Residual risk after \ntreatment should be reassessed. \n•Tolerate . Provided that a risk falls below the tolerance line, a commander may decide t o\nt\nolerate the risk without attempting treatment. Where the reward is sufficiently great, a\ncommander may choose to tolerate the threat. Risk appetite may also be increased t o\nac\ncommodate a specific threat.\n•Transfer . Where a risk cannot be treated, and a commander is unwilling to tolerate it,\nthe option to transfer the risk elsewhere may be sought, usually up the chain of\ncommand for the higher HQ to ‘own’ the risk and then create plans to mitigate or exploit\nit.\n•Take . Where an\noppor\ntunity exists,\nthe philosophy of\nMission Comm and\nem\npowers\ncommanders to\nseize it byoperating withi\nn\nt\nheir superior\ncommander’s intent\nand attitude to risk.\nTaking risk is a key\nway to seize t he\ni\nnitiative.  To\nac\nhieve success,\ncommanders hav e\nt\no judge and accept\nrisks. Taking risk i s\ni\nnherent in effective \nmilitary operations,in which commanders at all levels achieve their intent by seeking opportunities then\nvigorously seizing and exploiting them. The nature of conflict means that mili tary activity\nis seldom, if ever, risk -free.\n10.15.  Reserves.  Some risks will occur which are unforeseen.   Operationally, a \ncommander will always keep a reserve, traditionally not less than 1/9th of his force, to \nmitigate risks or exploit opportunities.  They may also warn a reserve to mitigate or exploit \nrisks or opportunities using ‘Be Prepared to’ Tasks in the Reserve’s Mission. \n10.16.  Dispensations .  A dispensation is required when it is believed necessary to operate \nan item of equipment outside its endorsed safety case (operating risk). Examples include \ndrivers not holding the correct licence, vehicles operating above their gross weight etc.  \n10.17.  Waivers .  A waiver is required when a commander wishes to operate outside of \nTTPs  or formal directives  (operational & tactical risk) . The most common waivers relate to \nECM and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). There are two types of dispensation / waiver:  \n•Continuous.  Applicable to situations or requirements that the drafting formation orunit identifies as enduring.\n•Operation Specific .  Used to cover an identified requirement within the estimat\ne\npr\nocess for a specific operation.  If approved, this type of request will only apply t o\nt\nhose forces involved in the operation and will expire once the operation has  been\nc\nompleted\nFigure 10. 7 The NATO Operational Risk Template\nSERIAL 3-01-11 \n3–01–11 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 202 3 WARGAMING  \n11.1.  What is Wargaming?  – A flexible tool used in the estimate process for the \ndevelopment, comparison, improvement and identification of short comings in friendly \ncourses of action (COA).  This is achieved through the employment of adversarial \ntechniques which pit one’s own pot ential COA against the assessed adversary (enemy) \nCOA.  \n11.2.  How can a Wargame support the DMMP estimate process?  - To derive the \nmaximum benefit from the wargame, a significant level of COA detail is required. As such, \nwargaming is most successfully employed during Steps 4- 7 as shown in the figure 11.1 \nbelow:  \n \nFigure 11. 1 Shows when in the estimate process a wargame can be used to improve a product  \n11.3.  When should I Wargame?  – As often as time and resource allows; to both execute \nthe wargame and implement outcomes. Normally this will be only once or twice; normally in \nstep 4, or if time is short, step 6.  \n11.4.  What are the different types \nof Wargame?  - the commander will \ndirect whether he wishes to  \nwargame an operation in its entirety, \nspecific phases, specific objectives \nor individual Decisive Conditions or \npoints within the operation. The methodology employed will largely \nbe dependent on what it is that the \nComd wishes to wargame.  \n11.5.  Wargame Preparation : \nBefore starting a Wargame, a common understanding by all participants of the purpose, required preparation, method of execution and evaluation has to be achieved.  \n11.6.  Wargame Location: The room in which the wargaming will take place needs to be \nprepared so that all participants can overlook the situation display and recorded information. The Blue and Red Cells are seated opposite of each other in order to underline the confrontational character. The Judgement panel  is situated between the cells to keep a \ngeneral overview  \n11.7.  COA documents: For each cycle the Blue and Red Cells will then prepare the \ndocuments and content necessary for the execution of the wargame. This will include a \ngeneral overview of the COA and EN COA based on the COA summary templates showing: \nPhase start state and obj ectives; CONOPS; assumptions; CCIRs; synchronisation matrix; \nrisk matrix and desired phase endstate.  \n \n   Phase 1     Phase 2     Phase 3      Phase 4    Phase 5   Fr COA\nEn COA\nTurn\n 1\nTurn\n 2\nTurn\n 3\nFigure 11. 2 Illustrating the Belt Method of wargaming COA phases  \nSERIAL 3-01-11 \n3–01–11 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 202 3 11.8.  Wargame Personnel :  The following roles need to be allocated:  \n• Blue Cell Players  – COA Team or J3, 3/5, 5 Cell . \n• Red Cell Players – Who may or may not be based \non the planning Red Team depending on the role \nselected for them by the Comd.  \n• SMEs  – Including all specialists, LOs & \nComponent Command representatives.  \n• Military Judgement Panel  – Which act as both \nthe control and adjudicators and is usually headed \nup by the COS.  \n• Recording Team  – Recording key decisions and   \nenduring that detail is reflected in the \nsynchronisation  matrices.  \n11.9.  Wargaming \nExecution:  Wargaming \nstarts with the \nintroduction to the \ntheatre situation. The ensuing sequences comprise the \npresentation of the \nrespective Friendly COA \nand En COA to be analysed, the game \nturns and the final \nassessment. A game \nturn starts with the \npresentation of the initial \nsituation, followed by the \nmovement divided into \n“Action“, “Reaction“, and “Counteraction“, and the \nsubsequent analysis & \njudgement phase.  \n11.10.  The number of \nsequences played will relate to the number & combination of all COA \nand En COA to be \nanalysed. In case of two COA and two En COA, \nfor example, four \nsequences will have to \nbe examined. Ideally, for the En COA, the most dangerous and most likely COA have to be \nlooked at as a minimum.  If time is short; judgement will be required to focus on the most \nappropriate COAs.  \nSequence 1: Fr COA 1 Vs En COA Most Dangerous :\nIntroduction to the Operational Situation :\n - Background ; mission statement ; objectives ; endstate\nPresentation of  Summary of :\n Fr COA 1 & Most Dangerous En COA \nFinal Analysis & Assessment of COA Sequence\nGame  Turn 1\nMove\nInitial\nSituation\nJudgement\nPhase\nAction\n Reaction\nCounter -\nAction\nSequence 2: Fr COA 1 Vs En COA : Most Likely :\nPresentation of  Summary of :\n Fr COA 1 & Most Likely En COA \nStructure the same as sequence 1 aboveFigure 11. 3 Illustrating how a  wargame should be set out  \nFigure 11. 4 Showing a wargame sequence of 3 turns  followed by a 2nd sequence  \nSERIAL 3-01-11 \n3–01–11 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 11.11.

Wargame of COA Phases (Belt Method):   \nAllows the modelling of all the DCs and O Es across \nall the lines of operation, either by phase or pre -\ndetermined time slot. In turn this allows the \ndevelopment of a robust understanding of the \nresource implications and activity de- confliction \nrequirements of each CoA.  \n11.\n14. Wargame Of COA Lines of Operation (Avenue \nMethod):  Despite the Avenue Methodology having \nless utility when examining campaign plans \nholistically it retains benefit as it allows for a more in -depth investigation of specific lines of \noperation and provides greater clarity with \nregard to potential CONPLANS, timescales \nand the cumulative sourcing effects across a particular line of operation.  \n11.\n15. Wargame Of Objectives or Decisive \nConditions  (Box Method) : This approach \ncovers key objectives or decisive conditions (DC) and the operational effects (OE) that underpin them over the phases in which they will be \nexecuted.    This is most effectively achieved \nusing the box methodology which is appropriately used when time is short or critical events or \nelements of the plan require investigation in \nsignificant detail  \n11.\n16.

What is Decision Making and Military Planning (DMMP)?   DMMP is a formal \nprocess of planning to consider problems and construct Courses of Action (COAs).  \nEstimates are planning tools that enable military commanders to make timely and \nappropriate decisions and to generate plans and orders.   Estimates range in complexity from \nthe extensive analysis and briefings that take place in large component  or formation \nheadquarters , ships  or battalion Command Posts (CPs), where there is a full staff and plenty \nof time, down to the rapid assessment and decisions made in contact by commanders in \ncontact or at company  level and below.  \n1.2. Planning Characteristics.  Planning is a dynamic process of interrelated activities \nrather than a single linear process.   Planning is command led and continually updated.  HQ \nstaff will assist in the planning process, but ultimately it is the commander’s plan,  and he \ndrives its development , underlining that planning is an intellectual activity, aided, but not \ndriven by an estimate process.  Although each campaign or operation is unique, all planning \nactivity shares a common purpose: to translate superior co mmander’s objectives & intent \ninto orders and activity for the subordinate HQs and units.  This process is also known as \nOperational Art and requires the commanders at all levels to make decisions and plan.  \n1.3. Operations Planning.  Operations Planning is the planning of military operations at \nthe strategic, operational or tactical levels.  The preferred English term to designate the \nplanning of military operations at all levels is ”operations planning”. The term ”operational \nplanning” is not to be used so as to prevent confusion with operational -level planning. ( AJP-\n5) See Figure 1.1 and 1.12 to show how operations planning links to the level of operations . \nWhat is Operational Art?  Operational art is the critical link between strategy and tactics.  \nStrategy and policy guide operational art by determining the ultimate objectives to be \nachieved and by allocating the necessary military and non -military resources.  Strategy also \nFigure 1. 1 Operations Planning  – showing linkages between the levels  \nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 defines and imposes limitations  (Constraints & Restraints)  on the use of one’s armed forces \nand sets conditions for tactical force employment .  (AJP- 5 para 1.2)  \nThe definition of Operational Art is : “The employment of forces to attain strategic and/or \noperational objectives through the design, organisation, integration and conduct of \nstrategies, campaigns, major operations and battles.”   (AAP- 6).   \n1.4. The 3 Elements of \nOperational Art .  Simply put, \nOperational art is realized through \ncombining a commander’s skills and \nvision with  the staff -assisted processes \nof operations design and operations \nmanagement , illustrated in Fig  1.2 and \nsummed up  in Fig 1. 3. \n1.5. Commander’s Vision & Skill .  \nThe Commander bears responsibility \nfor the planning and conduct of the operation.  In order to provide effective \nguidance, the commander must be able to stand back from detailed \nplanning to frame the larger context, \nset forth objectives and priorities, \nidentify opportunities and risks, and \nformulate operational ideas that maximize the effectiveness, responsiveness and flexibility of the force.  Commanders are supported by \ntheir staffs, who  conduct  the detailed planning and assessments. \n1.6. What is Operations Design?  Operations design frames the environment and the \nproblem, and then develops or refines possible options  (COAs) that give a comprehensive \nlogic to the operation.  Operations design interprets  the Commander’s  vision , conducts \nestimate s and devel ops and then refines  the Concept of Operation (CONOPS) .  The \nplanning team then sequence and synchronise actions and resources in time and space to complete the  plans and orders  for subordinates .  Figure 1. 2 The 3 Elements of Operational  Art\nFigure 1. 3 Tasks  & Activities within t he \n3 Elements of Operational Art\nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.7. What is Operations Management?   Operations management then translates the \noperations design, plans and orders into action by integrating, coordinating, synchronizing \nand prioritizing activity  across the joint functions.  The commander and staff use operations \nassessment  to review  progress.  The tactical  component  level supports operations \nassessment with tactical assessment input.  Operations assessment findings regularly lead \nto the refinement of the operations design, plans and orders .  \n1.8. The Operations Process.   The \nOperations Process consists of : \n•Assessing\n•Planni ng\n•P\nreparing\n•Executing\nAs Figure 1.4 shows, the commander is \ncentral  to the process.  While the activities \nare cyclical  and continuous, they do not \nnecessarily  occur sequentially. It  is \nimportant to note  that planning, preparing \nand executing do not always have distinct \nstart and end points.  Planning is a \ncontinuous activity within  the process.  \nWhile preparing for one operation, or during \nits execution, formations or  units will be \nrefining the current plan, or planning for future operations. Preparation  is also a continuous activity, even when a formation or unit is \nnot executing an operation.   Preparation always overlaps with planning and continues \nthroughout execution for some subordinate units. The task of Assessing surrounds and \npermeates the other three activities.  Finally, staff must understand that subordinate \nformations, or units within the  same command, may be in different stages of the Operations \nProcess at any given time.   The Operations Process links and gives coherence to the 3 \nelements of Operational Art  as shown in Figure 1. 5 below . \nFigure 1. 4 The Operations Process  \nFigure 1. 5  \nThe Operations \nProcess linking \nthe 3 elements of \nOperational Art\nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.9. The 4 Activities  of the Operations Process.   Figure 1.6 shows the tasks that fall \nwithin each of the four activities of the  Operations Process.  This is not an all -encompassing \nbreakdown but gives an idea of the main tasks that fall to the Commander and his Staff.  \n1.\n10. Roles of the Commander and Staff :  In NATO  doctrine, t he Commander bears \nresponsibility for the planning and conduct of the operation.  However, he is supported by his \nstaff.  The Commander and staff  have different but overlapping and complementary roles  to \ndeliver the Operational Art  through the Operations Process , as shown in Figure 1. 7 below.  \nFigure 1. 6 The Tasks within the 4 x Activities of t he Operations Process \nFigure 1.7 Illustrating the roles and characteristics of the commander and staff \n\nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.11.  A good commander also knows : \n•To achieve tempo - a plan that is 80% complete but delivered on time is preferabl e\nt\no one that is 100% complete but late.\n•To enable Mission Command  - Commanders  must provide clear and timely\ndirection, particularly in their intent. They must direct 1 -down but always think  and\nr\nesource 2- down.\n•The estimate is a means to an end  - the actual decision the commander makes is\nmore important than the decision- making process. However, elements of that\nprocess, particularly the mission analysis and Intelligence Preparation of t he\nE\nnvironment (IPE), are important components to help inform their decision making.\n1.12.  For DMMP, A Commander Needs: \n•A Staff (Trained!)\n•A HQ (Life Support)\n•Communication & Information System s\n•P\nlanning Processes & Procedures (Estimate)\n1.13.  Pl\nanning:  “Planning is the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioning a \ndesired future, and laying out effective ways of bringing about that future”  \n1.14.  What is a Plan?  A Plan is : “A detailed proposal for doing or achieving something” .  \nPlanning is the process of doing this.  \n1.15.  What is an Estimate?   “A logical process of reasoning by which a commander \nconsiders all the circumstances affecting the military situation and arrives at a decision as to \nthe course of action to be taken in order to accomplish his mission.”   (AAP- 06) The estimate \nprovides the intellectual underpinning process to the commander’s vision & skill.  It allows \nboth the commander and his staff to think  creatively about the achievement of the objectives \nset.  It is enabled by the collective skill, knowledge and ex perience of the commander and \nhis staff to  design and manage the operation, and to employ military forces.  \n1.16.  Why are \nthere different \nPlanning and \nEstimate Methods?  \nMost NATO nations \nand some force \nelements such as SF, \nCIS and Logistics have a slightly \ndifferent estimate and \nplanning methods  \ntailored to their particular set of circumstances .  \nHowever, all planning processes & \nestimates have the \nsame core activities, shown in Figure 1. 8. \nFigure 1. 8 Illustrating all planning processes have the same core activities  \nSERIAL 3-02-01 \n3–02–01 - 6 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024  \n1.17.

After a short interval, HQs \nplan in parallel but in collaboration with HQ above and below (shown by overlap). Aided by \nLiaison Officers and Warning Orders.  \n1.19.  Planning Horizons .  Planning involves an appreciation for planning horizons. \nBecause the future is always uncertain, planning should not specify future actions with \nprecision.  Rather, future plans must remain flexible and adaptable, allowing the opportunity \nto pursue a variety of options.   As plans extend further into the future, they become less a \nmatter of trying to direct events and more a matter of identifying options and possibilities.  \nKey to this is the ability to determine future enemy actions; assumptions on which to plan \nagainst must be made and continually validated. If unable to predict enemy actions with \nreasonable certainty, the plan must keep friendly options open until intelligence builds a \nclearer picture.  The example below shows an example of operational -level time horizons.   \nCross \nGovernment\nStrategic\nMOD\nMilitary \nStrategic\nJTFHQ \nOperational\nComponent \nTactical\nCross government Strategic\nMOD Military Strategic\nJTFHQ Operational\nComponent  \nTactical\nJ5 Plan\nJ3/5 \nPrepare\nJ3 Execute\n•FUTURE PLANS \n•CONOPS & OPLAN\n•Weeks –Months –Years\n•FUTURE OPERATIONS\n•Operation Order or Joint \nCoordination Order\n•72 Hours - 7 Days\n•CURRENT OPERATIONS\n•FRAGOs & R2\n•Current 0 - 72 HoursFigure 1. 10 Illustrating Parallel Planning  \nFigure 1. 11 \nIllustrating the \n3 Planning \nHorizons in a \nHeadquarters  Figure 1. 9 Illustrating sequential planning  \nNow Future  \nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Figure 1. 12 Illustrating the relationship between strategic, operational -level and tactical level planning  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-02 \n3–02–02 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 THE COMBAT  ESTIMATE (7 QUESTIONS)  \n2.1. Combat Estimate (CE) .  The CE, also known as the ‘7 Questions’,  is used in the \nLand environment .  It is derived from the standard estimate but presents the analysis, plan \ncreation and decision- making in a sequence of 7 questions.  This is intended to make it easy \nto focus on rapid understanding of the problem and decision- making as part of accelerated \nbattle procedure.  The CE is designed to generate plans for single, urgent tactical problems, \nyet can be adapted for more complex, deliberate actions.  It assumes that the operating \nenvironment and general tactical situation are already well understood.  It is used for \nproblems to be executed quickly (as a guide, within 72 hours), and because of the nature of \nbattlegroup operations it is always the tool used at that level and below .  It may also be used \nat the brigade level  if quick execution is required.  Consequently, the CE can be used by an \nindividual commander or with a supporting headquarters staff.  \nFigure 2. 1 The Combat Estimate (7 Questions)  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-03 \n3–02–03 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 TACTICAL  ESTIMATE  \n3.1. What is the Tactical Estimate?   The Tactical Estimate (TE)  is used when the \ntactical problem is complex,  and plans may be longer term and involve significant \nsequencing.  There must therefore be sufficient time (over 96 Hrs) to complete a thorough \nassessment of the situation and the resultant plan may well link a number of tactical actions, \nthrough time and across the Battlespace.  Although it is typically the preserve of the higher \ntactical level (LCC or Division), a Brigade HQ should use the TE when planning a deliberate, \ncomplex, multinational operation, and the CE for subsequent tactical actions.  \n3.2. Process.   TE is taken from  the NATO  APP - 28 – Tactical Planning for Land Forces . \nIt consists of analysis in seven linked st eps, very similar  in format, processes  and outputs to \nthe 7 step AJP -5 Estimate .  When higher tactical level Land units (LCC or Div) are operating \nwithin the context of a Joint Operational or Campaign Plan, the TE estimate will typically be used to produce a tactical plan in support of an overarching campaign/  operational -level \nplan.   \n \nFigure 3.1  The Tactical Estimate  Figure 3.2  The Tactical Estimate  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 THE 7 STEP  ESTIMATE ( AJP-5 Ed A Version 2 + UK Change 1 ) \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5   \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5   \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 6 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 8 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 9 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 11 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5   \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 12 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 13 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 14 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 15 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 16 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 17 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 18 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 19 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-03-02 \n3–03–02 - 1 \nOr\niginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT – BATTLE RHYTHM \n2.1. Operations Management . A critical function of the commander is to manage the \njoint operations  area to assist in coordinating and synchronizing joint force component \nactions.  Commanders should strive to integrate military actions and coordinate activity  \nbetween military and non -military actors to achieve coherency .  (AJP- 3) \n•Coordination. When two or more force elements operate in the same battlespace their\nactivities should be coordinated, and where necessary, integrated. Where these activities\nare concurrent and cannot be separated, they should be subject to some form of control .\n•Synchronization. Synchronized actions, within the overall construct of orchestrated\nactions, is standard practice at the operational level. Synchronizing action often requireforce elements to agree and commit, in advance, to coordinating courses of action(COAs) to resolv e anticipated conflict. Synchronized actions may comprise elements\nworking independently (but known to each other) and/or elements working closely\ntogether.  This approach enables the efforts of otherwise discrete force elements to be\nconcentrated, at a time and place that is anticipated to be decisive .\n2.2. The H Q Management P rocess.  The co mmander and st aff use  a number of \nprocesses and procedures,  such as j oint pl anning and targeting, t o support num erous JTF \nHQ r equirements, activities,  and pr oducts. IM, the JT F HQ decisi on cycle, and battle rhythm \nare especially important for the effic ient management of everyday JTF HQ operations. \n2.3. (J oint Task Force) He adquarters De cision Cy cle. The HQ dec ision cy cle is a \nmethod t hat depi cts how command and st aff el ements de termi ne requir ed actions,  codify \nthem i n directives and or ders,  execute \nthem, and m onitor t heir r esults.  The \ndecision cycle has f our p hases linked by \ncommunication enabled by battle rhythm : \n•M\nonitor . Monitoring involves measuring\nongoing activities that may impact the\noperating environment or impactongoing or future operations.\n•\nAssess. Within the JTF HQ decision\ncycle, assessment is determining theimpact of events as they relate to overallmission accomplishment. This is the\noperations assessment process.\n•Plan . In the planning portion of the \ndecision cycle, the commander and staffmake adjustments to the current plan or develop new plans, branches, or sequels withthe purpose of successful completion of the overall mission.\n•Direct . The commander directs actions to ensure that current orders and directives are\ncompleted as intended. This direction is done with the broader purpose of accomplishingthe overall mission. Tools like the commander’s intent and CCIRs assist the commanderin this role. The preponderance of the commander’s directing function is conducted by\nthe joint operations centre (JOC).\nFigure 2. 1  Headquarters decision cycle\nSERIAL 3-03-02 \n3–03–02 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 2.4. Cross- functional organizations that support the joint task force headquarters \nstaff as part of the battle rhythm .  These functional integrating structures provide the \nforums for bringing together members of the staff to focus on specific requirements to \nprovide recommendations to the commander.  See Serial  2-01-02. \n2.5. What is Battle Rhythm ?  The m ethod used to fuse staff effort, regulate and control \noperations is called  the battle rhythm (also sometimes called campaign rhythm  at Op level) .  \nThis is a regular reoccurring sequence of boards, meetings, briefings and miscellaneous \ngatherings contained within a defined time  cycle , harmonised across the whole joint force \nand used to maintain an optimum tempo for all levels of command, location and time zone.   \nBattle Rhythm Processes \n2.6. Activity & Assessment  Cycle:  See Serial 3 -03-04. \n• Activity Review :  The HQ manages the activity currently under execution to implement \nthe OPLAN/Operation Order (OPORD).  Measurement of performance (MOP) informs \nthe process, which may require adjustment to priorities, activities, the apportionment of \nassets and resources, or the employment of any operational reserves.  Done by J3 Operations and changes made through a FRAGO.  \n• Effects Review . Informed by the measurement of effectiveness  (MOE), progress \ntowards the supporting effects articulated in the commander’s plan.  Changes can be made to redress shortcomings or reinforce success in achieving supporting effects.   \nChanges are made by activating Contingency Plans (CONPLANs) and through the issue of FRAGOs to promulgate the change. J3 Operations Support are responsible for the effects review.  \n• Campaign Review .  In conjunction with the effects review, the JTFC continually reviews \nprogress towards decisive conditions and his operational end- state. This process is \ninformed by Operations  assessment, which includes periodic review of the whole \ncampaign plan. J5 is responsible for the campaign review.  \n2.7. Situational Awareness.  A variety of tools can be used to engender understanding, \naid de- confliction, and enhance synchronization. Eg Common  operating picture , reports and \nreturns .

Joint Targeting Coordination Board (JTCB) .  The Joint targeting coordination \nboard reviews target information, develops targeting guidance and priorities while preparing \nand refining joint target lists to recommend to the joint task force command (JTFC). During operations, the joint targeting coordination board will also maintain a restricted target li st. \nThe joint targeting coordination board is the primary agency for synchronizing and managing joint targeting efforts. It will: prepare target lists for joint coordination board review and, if necessary, JFC approval; validate changes in the targeting database; and coordinate target material production, as developed through the targeting process . The JTCB would have a \nnumber of subordinate working groups and boards supporting it and preparing detailed staff \nwork  related to targeting and effects . \n2.23.

What is  Joint Targeting?  Joint targeting involves the process of selecting and \nprioritising targets (which are classified as being either facility, individual, virtual entity, \nequipment or organization (FIVE -O) and matching the appropriate response to them .  \n3.2. Legal Compliance .  Joint targeting must be conducted in a manner which ensures \ncompliance with the applicable legal framework, especially International Humanitarian Law/Law of Armed Conflict (IHL/LOAC) principles. It must also be conducted in order to ensure that any risk of  civilian casualties or collateral damage is proportionate compared \nwith the expected military advantage to be gained.  \n3.3. What is a target?   An area, structure, object, person, or group of people against \nwhich lethal or non- lethal capability can be employed to create specific psychological or \nphysical effects. Notes: The term 'person' also covers their mindset, thought processes, attitudes and behaviours. (AJP- 3.9) \n3.4. Full Spectrum  Targeting  Approach:  The full -spectrum approach provides a \ncoherent range of options and effects that aims to optimize military action by avoiding duplication of effort, effects negating each other and ensures that the right targets are prosecuted in the right order, at the right time by the right capabilities. It recognizes that effects will be created by actions in the physical, virtual, or cognitive dimensions in a \nsynchronized way, and that both lethal and non -lethal engagement can create physical, \nvirtual and cognitive (i.e., psychological/behavioural) effects.  \n3.5. Actions & Effects .  Joint  targeting involves taking actions in one or more of the \noperational domains, using all capabilities available, against a target, in order to create an \neffect in one or more of the physical, virtual, or cognitive dimensions. These actions taken \nand the effects subsequently created, can range from lethal to non- lethal.  \n3.6. Target Engagement Authority ( TEA) .  Target engagement authority is the authority \ngranted to a Commander to approve target engagement.   The Commander ’s target \nengagement authority can  subsequently be delegated further, if permitted, and after \nconsideration for the specified target set, the risk level, and/or use of capabilities and/or collateral damage level.   During planning and execution, the JTF/CC and their staff must be \naware of any national caveats, additional restrictions or considerations depending on the \nsituation that could affect assigning resources for target engagement. National caveats are reported through appropriate national representatives. \n3.7. The Engagement Continuum.  Engagements and actions can take place across a \nwide spectrum. The engagement continuum and related activities are depicted in Figure 3. 1 \nbelow.   \n3.8. Deliberate targeting . Deliberate targeting is conducted against validated targets \nknown to exist and intended to be prosecuted on either a scheduled or on -call basis. \nDeliberate targeting results in targets being properly subject to quality control, validated and being placed on the joint target list (JTL) or restricted target list (RTL). Deliberate targeting \nnormally supports the JTF’s future operations and future plans efforts.   Deliberate targeting \nalso identifies the JFC’s Time- Sensitive Targets (TSTs) . \nSERIAL 3-03-03 \n3–03–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 \n3.9. Dynamic targeting . Dynamic targeting engages targets that due to the dynamic \nchanges in operations, present a threat to force or mission but were not detected, located, or \nselected for action in sufficient time to become a deliberate target.  Engaging these targets \nmay be possible by redirecting existing assets in accordance with the Commander JTFs \nintent and targeting guidance.   Dynamic targeting is normally employed in current operations \nplanning 24 hour period.  \n3.10.  Combat Engagement .  Action against an adversary, in accordance with IHL/LOAC, \napproved rules of engagement, outside of self -defence, to accomplish missions and tasks \nduring operations when it is not feasible to conduct either deliberate or dynamic targeting due to the immediacy of the engagement.  \n3.11.  Joint  Targeting Cycle.    The Joint Targeting  \nCycle is shown in Figure 3. 2.  The joint targeting  \ncycle (JTC) has a logical progression  \nthat aids decision- making and  \nprovides the JFC with a  \nmethodology linking objectives  \nwith effects throughout  \n the battlespace.  \nFigure 3. 1 The Engagement Continuum  \nFigure 3. 2 The Joint \nTargeting Cycle showing \nthe link to component \ntactical targeting\nSERIAL 3-03-03 \n3–03–03 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 Target Lists  \n3.12.  Candidate Target List. (CATL) .  A list of entities submitted by nations, component \ncommand or appropriate organizations, that are in target development and have not yet \nbeen validated.  Note:   Once entities on the CATL have been validated, they can be included \non the Joint Target List or the Restricted Target List and be considered for inclusion on the \nTarget Nomination List . \n3.13.  No-Strike lists (NSL).  NSL is a list of objects or entities characterized as protected \nfrom the effects of military operations under international law or policy reasons.   As such, \nthey must not be engaged until they lose that protection and, consequently, become subject to lawful engagement.   \n3.14.  Joint Target List (JTL) .  The JTL is managed by the Joint Targets Coordination \nBoard (JTCB) with oversight maintained for the JFC by the J oint Coordination Board (JC B). \nThe targets on the JTL are not finally legally cleared against ROE, relevant international law, national caveats until such time as they are selected for engagement . \n3.15.  Restricted Target List (RTL). RTL is a valid target that has specific constraints \nand/or restraints placed on the actions authorized against it due to operational \nconsiderations.    \n3.\n16. Joint Prioritised Target List (JPTL ).  The JPTL is a list of targets that have been \nlegally scrutinised, risk assessed and have been prioritised in line with campaign objectives \nby the JTCB.  It is derived from the JTL and de-conflicted with all components and relevant \norganisations ; is the end product of the target development phase(s).  \nFigure 3. 3 Joint Targeting Lists & linkages  \nSERIAL 3-03-03 \n3–03–03 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 3.17.

It is forwarded to the JTCB for consideration. The target nomination list \ncontains targets being nominated for the JPTL.  \nTarget Definitions from AJP 3.9 : \n3.18.  Engagement .  In the context of rules of engagement, action taken against a target \nwith intent to deter, damage or neutralize it.  \n3.19.  Fires. The use of weapon systems to create a specific lethal or nonlethal effect \non a target.  \n3.20.  Target .  An area, structure, object, person, or group of people against which lethal or \nnon-lethal capability can be employed to create specific psychological or physical effects. \nNotes: The term 'person' also covers their mindset, thought processes, attitudes and behaviours.  \n3.21.  Component Critical Target .  A target requiring immediate response as directed by \nthe component commander and whose destruction is of high priority to achieve tactical \nobjectives . \n3.22.  Restricted Target .  A valid target that has specific constraints and/or restraints \nplaced on the actions authorized against it due to operational considerations.  \n3.23.  Sensitive Target .  A target for which planned actions requires NATO strategic -level \nand/or national- level review and approval.  \n3.24.  High Value Target :  A target identified as critical to an actor or organisation for \nachieving its goal.  \n3.25.  High Pay off Target :  high- value target, the successful influencing of which will offer \ndisproportionate advantage to friendly forces.  High pay-off targets are determined by the \nvalue they offer to friendly forces rather than other actors.  \n3.26.  Time Sensitive Targets :  Those targets requiring immediate response because they \npose (or will soon pose) a danger to friendly forces or are highly lucrative, fleeting targets of opportunity whose destruction is of high priority to achieve campaign objectives. The time available does not allow for the standard targeting timeline to be followed.  \n3.27.

Assessment Definitions: \n•“A considered process of appraisal to support decision making.” (AAP- 06)\n•“the activity that enables the measurement of progress and results of operations in a\nmilitary context, and the subsequent development of conclusions and recommendations\nthat support decision making.” (NATO Assessment Handbook )\n4.2. What is the Purpose of Assessment?  The purpose of operations assessment is to \ninform the commander if the operation is being executed as planned and if the operation is achieving the desired results. Operations assessment is critical because no planning \nprocess can guarantee success, and progress must be continually reviewed against \nachievement of objectives so that plans can be adjusted as necessary  \n4.3. Levels of Assessment .  The assessment of the campaign encompasses the \nstrategic assessment, the operational -level assessment and the tactical assessment. Each \nof these levels supports the assessment of the next level.  It is fundamental to successful \noperations as it provides the means for keeping the operational situation and progress under \ncontinual review; using a structured mix of subjective and objective measurement . \n4.4. Assessment is Command Led:  The Commander should review (at Assessment \nBoard) and adjust initial planning based upon the results of assessment, which has been \ndesigned to:  \n•evaluate the execution of activities by the (joint) force;\n•evaluate the effectiveness of those activities;\n•show  whether the situation is developing favourably.\nThe outputs of the assessment process (assessment working group (AWG) and assessment \nboard(AB) ) feed recommendations to the Commander for modification and change through  \nthe battle rhythm; plan – prepare  - execute planning cycles  (J5 – J3/5 – J3) used in Joint \nHQs and shown in Figure 4.1 below . \nFigure 4. 1 Illustrates how assessment feeds into the 3 -decision making and planning cycles  \nAssessment Process in Battle Rhythm\nComponents \nCollect \nAssessment \nData\nPlan : J5\nOutputs –OSW :\nOPLAN\nCONPLAN\nAssessment\nPrepare : J35\nOutputs –OSW :\nJCO\nFRAGO\nExecute : J3/JOC\nOutputs –OSW :\nCoord FRAGO\nOp (tac) activity\nSA inclR2\nConsequence Mgt\nLong Term\n Mid Term\n Short TermHandoverHandover\nEffects \nWG\nJCB \nWG\nJCB\nAssessment \nWorking \nGROUP \n(AWG )\nAssessment \nBoard (AB)\nChanges \nJCB\nSERIAL 3-03-04 \n3–03–04 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 4.5. Assessment during  OP Design (Plan)  and Management  (Execute) : The \noperations assessment process involves four stages:  \n•Assessment design and support to planning . This is done during the estimat e\npr\nocess -steps 3 to 6.\n•Development of a data collection plan . This is done in step 7, writing the OPLAN .\n•Data collection and treatment . This is done during execution, mainly at the tactical\nlevel.\n•Analysis, interpretation and recommendations ; during execution battle rhythm by t he\nA\nssessment Working Group (AWG) and Assessment Board  (AB) to inform decisi on\nm\naking to alter current or future plans.\nFigure 4. 2  Illustrating how assessment of planning concepts  and the OSW that is then changed if required  \nAssessment Categories and Terminology  \n4.6. Measure of Performance (MOP) : “A criterion that is tied to measuring task \naccomplishment in order to assess friendly actions. ” (AAP- 6) This is a metric used to \nmeasure the completion of actions (not just those undertaken): ‘ Are we doing things right?’  \nEg Battle Damage Assessment.  \n4.7. Measure of Effectiveness (MOE) “A criterion used to assess changes in system \nbehaviour, capability, or operating environment, tied to measuring the attainment of an end \nstate, achievement of an objective, or creation of an effect”  (AAP- 15)  This is a  metric used \nto measure a current ‘system state’ and to inform achievement of intended and unintended \noperational effects that are caused as a result of actions: “Are doing the right things ?” \n4.8. Operational -level Operations  Assessment . This focuses  on the desired effects \nand is aligned with the planning horizons to support both operations synchronization ( J3/5 \nmid-term planning) and operations planning ( J5 long-term planning). This distinction is not a \nfundamental delineation between a mid-term and a long- term operations assessment but \nrather a difference in emphasis. An assessment of progress towards the end of the current \nphase or upcoming decisive conditions is required to support course of action development \nor adjustment and, possibly, branch planning; whereas an assessment of progress towards \n\nSERIAL 3-03-04\n3–03–04 - 3\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020the achievement of objectives is required to support planning for sequels, termination  and\nt\nransition.\n4.9. Tactical -level Operations Assessment .  At the tactical level operations assessment\nmeasures the achievement of planned actions, tasks or activities for each particular\ncomponent.\n4.10. Branch Plans – developed as a CONPLAN to provide alternative ways and means\nto achieve the same DC.\n4.11. Seque ls – developed as a CONPLAN to provide a method for dealing wit h\nal\nternative outcomes from a phase. (ie: if the outcome is as expected we do ‘A’; if the result\nis unexpected, we do ‘B’)\n4.12. Assessment  Approaches .  The are 4 basi c approaches to designing the\nMeasures of Effectiveness:\n•Quantitative : A number representing an amount.\n•Qualitative : An observation that represents a category.\n•Objective : Facts and the measurement of things or concepts that actually exist i.e.\nNOT influenced by personal feelings, experience or opinions.\n•Subjective : An individual’s personal opinion, experience and judgement i.e. ‘Gut’\nfeeling.\n4.13. How t o Design Measures of Effectiveness .  Measurement o f effectiveness  should \nprovide clear indications of change and effect.  However, absolute, unequivoc al \nmeasurement will rarely be achievable.  In particular, influence and CIMIC activities , which  \nseek to realise s ubtle psychological effects , sometimes over protracted periods, may be very  \ndifficult to measure.  Kinetic  fires to achieve physical destruction effects are much easier to  \nmeasure as the link between activity and effect is often clear.

What is Operational Staff Work (OSW) ?  The final stage of the planning process  is \ncommunicating the plan.  Directives , plans  and orders provide the principal means by which \na commander’s intentions are  conveyed to his subordinates. \n1.2. T erminology : The terms below may appear to be close in meaning but have\ndistinct definitions in military use:  \n•Directives:  Used at the higher levels of command to give both general and specifi c\ngui\ndance to subordinate commanders on the outline CONOPS and to start planni ng\nac\ntivity.  It may/may not include missions to subordinates.\n•Plans: these provide the detailed CONOPS for a specified period of time and trigger t he\ndet\nailed synchronisation of military activities or actions.  Plans have no executiv e\naut\nhority until activated by an order.\n•Orders :  These are defined as “a communication, written, oral or by signal, which convey\ninstructions from a superior to a subordinate”.  They include sufficiently detail ed\ni\nnstructions to subordinates (in the form of missions & tasks with coordinated timings) s o\nt\nhey can deliver specific planned activities or required effects.\n•Instructions :  These are used to regulate routine, repeating military activity such as\norganisational responsibilities & routine administrative procedures or actions & ar e\nnor\nmally developed from SOPs. Formal instructions carry the equivalent authority to\ndirectives or orders. (eg HQ Standard Operating Instructions (SOIs) are used to amplify\nand shape HQ SOPs to local conditions).\nFigure 1. 1 Illustrates the operational staff work products produced by the CJTF HQ and component HQs  \nOr single document\nCampaign Plan \nor CONOPSExample Joint HQ & Component  OSW Outputs :\nForce Instruction Document (FID)\nOperation Plan\n(OPLAN )\nJoint \nCoordination \nOrder (JCO)\nFragmentary \nOrder (FRAGO )Time\nFuture \nTi me \nHorizon\nCurrent  \nTi me Refine  OSW\n to Increase  Level\n of Detail & \nSynchronisation\n as get closer\nto Execution\nGeneral\n Det ail\nSpecific\nSy nchronised\nDet ail\nJ5\nFUPLANS\nJ3/5\nFUOPS\nJ3/3\nCUOPSMaritime Land Air\nOPORD\nOPGEN\nOPTASK\nOPLAN\nOPORD\nFRAGO\nJoint Air \nOp erations \nPlan (JAOP )\nAir \nOp erations \nDirective \n(AOD)\nAir Tasking\nOrder (ATO)\nSpecial \nInstructions \n(SPINS )\nOPLAN  \nOPORD  \nFRAGO  \nSERIAL 3-04-01 \n3–04–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 Common principles of OSW : \n1.3. Timeliness .  OSW delivered late to subordinate HQs will give them insufficient \ntime to conduct their own planning and ultimately may lead to failure as execution \nwill be impossible.  An imperfect plan or order, on time, is better than a perfect plan delivered late.  \n1.4. Approach .  Where possible, we use template SOP formats to aid \nunderstanding and promote standardised procedure.  However, creativity to clearly communicate the commander ’s intentions should be encouraged.  \n1.5. Composition. Directives; Plans; Orders & Instructions should be:  \n•Concise: Only write enough detail that is necessary for a subordinate to achieve his\nmission.  Do not prescribe anything to a subordinate commander that he, with a fullerknowledge of the local conditions, should be better to decide himself. Otherwise you willconstrain his initiative.\n•Clear .  There should be no scope for ambiguity. Choose your words carefully and us\ne\nt\nhe correct staff duties and conventions.\n•Accurate.  Check & validate all factual data such as grid references, timings, orbats and\nROE.\n1.6. Annexes: The main purpose of annexes is to keep the basic text of OSW short.  \nAnnexes provide amplifying information that is not appropriate in the main OSW document, \nor information that amplifies a specific aspect.  \n1.7. Op Staff Duties: General Points. The main rule is that in operational writing the \nmaximum use is to be made of abbreviations and the text is to be written in note form to save time and space, remembering always that the meaning remains clear.  Paragraph \nheadings can form part of the opening of a sentence, eg ‘Ammo. Issued 1300 hrs’. Note that the syntax rules of JSP 101 apply, but the remaining conventions will not. \nMinor Rules . \n1.8. Exercise Protective Markings. In exercise protective markings the word \n‘EXERCISE’ is always to be abbreviated to ‘EX’, eg ‘EX SECRET’.  \n1.9. Proper Nouns. Proper nouns are written in capital letters, eg ‘SWINDON’, ‘River \nTONE’. 1.10.  Composite Nouns. Any composite noun, or one containing a prefix or suffix is to be \nabbreviated by abbreviating that part of it for which there is an authorised abbreviation, eg \n‘mob’ (mobilisation), ‘demob’ (demobilisation). \n1.11.  Abbreviations. Only those recognised abbreviations included may be used without \nan introduction. Where unofficial abbreviations are to be used they are to be introduced into \nthe order correctly. Some abbreviations indicate both the singular and plural. If the addition \nof an ‘s’ is necessary,  it is always placed at the end of the abbreviation eg: ‘CinCs’ \n(Commanders in Chief). An ‘s’ may be added only to the abbreviation of a noun; it is never to \nbe added to the abbreviation of a verb, eg ‘follows’ should be abbreviated to ‘fol’.  \n1.12.  Times . Times are to be expressed using the 24 -hour clock and the time zone suffix, \nunless an expedient such as ‘Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: BRAVO’ is inserted \nbelow the references.  \n1.13.  Description of Attachments/Detachments . Units which have elements detached \nare to be described using the convention illustrated below. The quantity of units/sub -units is \nalways written in full eg: 20 Armd Bde (less two bns) or 1 R IRISH (less one coy).  \nSERIAL 3-04-01 \n3–04–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 1.14.  Reported Speech . Reported speech is written as spoken without abbreviations and \nindented in single inverted commas. For example:   \nWe captured 3 offrs and 2 NCOs. They revealed en morale to be very poor. One of the \nNCOs said: ‘We have had no food supplied since 3 o’clock on Thursday of last week and we were promised that large stocks would be captured on the objective.’  \nGround Locations, Areas and Boundaries. \n1.15.  Locations and Points on the Ground. Locations and points on the ground may be \ndescribed by Grid Reference or by giving the direction and distance from a simple reference \npoint.  \n1.16.  Cardinal Points.  The 4 cardinal points of the compass are written in full, eg south. \nFor intermediate points the letters N, S, E and W are used, eg NE, SSW. Points of the \ncompass should always be considered in clockwise order from north.  \n1.17.  Names of Places and Features.  The names of places and features are spelt \nexactly as on the map in use, except that the word ‘River’, written in full, is to precede the names of all rivers regardless of the language in which this word appears on the map. The \ngrid reference  is to be given the first time the name of the place or feature occurs. It should \nbe shown as a bigram map code followed by the grid reference number, eg: ‘CN 493246’.  \n1.18.  Roads, Tracks and Railways.  Roads, tracks and railways are described by the \nnames of  places located on them. The word ‘road’, ‘track’ or ‘railway’ is to precede the place \nnames,  eg ‘railway Winchester -Basingstoke’. Sufficient place names should be used to \nensure the correct road / track / railway is identified.  \n1.19.  River banks.  Riverbanks  are described as right or left from the point of view of an  \nobserver facing downstream or, if this cannot be done, by issuing  cardinal points. ‘Near’ and  \n‘far’ may be used with reference to friendly forces involved in river crossing operations.  \n1.20.  Canals.  The names of a canal, or names of places on it, are used to describe a \ncanal. The banks are usually described by means of the cardinal points, eg: ‘the north bank \nof the Kiel  Canal’.  \n1.21.  Routes.  When movement is involved, a route is described by a sequence of points \non the route named, in the direction of movement. When no movement is involved, the \nsequence of points named is to be from left to right or rear to front, assuming that the person \ndesignating the route is facing the enemy. Cardinal points may be added if required. It is \ncommon to give a route a nickname for ease of reference.  \n1.22.  Areas .  An area is described by taking the northernmost point first and giving the  \nremaining points in clockwise order.  \n1.23.  Ground/Positions .  Ground and positions are described from left to right and front to \nrear facing the enemy. To avoid confusion, cardinal points may be used to describe flanks, \nrather than ‘left’ or ‘right’.  \n1.24.  Boundaries.  Boundaries are designated by easily distinguishable features on the \nground in the sequence in which they occur. They are to be described from rear to front during an advance and from front to rear in defence and withdrawal. If generally parallel to \nthe front, eg rear boundaries, they are to be described from left to right facing the enemy.  \nCardinal points may be added if required. When describing boundaries between units and formations, the words ‘inclusive’ or ‘exclusive’ are used before the place to which they refer. \nThe description of a boundary must state specifically to which unit or formation an area or a point is inclusive or exclusive.  \n1.25.  Directions. A direction may be indicated in one of 3 ways:  \noBy use of 2 locations or places, eg ‘direction Hannover -Dortmund’.\nSERIAL 3-04-01 \n3–04–01 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 oAs a point of the compass, eg ‘north’, ‘SE’.\noUsing a compass bearing, eg ‘5600 mils’.\n1.26.  Time. Time is specified using the 24 hour clock. The first pair of digits define the hour \nand the second pair the minutes past the hour, eg 1147 is 47 minutes past 11 o’clock in the \nmorning. The following rules should be noted:  \noQuoting the Time . The time can be followed by a time zone suffix or the wor d\n‘h\nours’ if  confusion with other figures is possible, eg: 1432 or 1432 hrs.\noMidnight . The word midnight is not to be used. The time 0000 hours defines the\ntime and the date defines the day, eg It is common practice to use either 2 359\nhour\ns or 0001  hours to avoid confusion. The term ‘2400 hrs’ is never to be us ed\nas\n a time of day.\noDate Time Groups . Date time groups are a method of showing times and dates\nin signal  messages or operation orders.

This section contains 3 tables of definitions for effects and actions\nterms used within mission terminology and associated tactical graphics.   Wherever possible,\nNATO definitions are used in order to enhance communication and interoperability while\nminimising the risks of misunderstandings. Where no NATO definition exists, UK only\nterminology has been included and the term highlighted in red.  It is advisable to provide\nthe UK definition to allies when UK terminology is used in the absence of a comparableNATO term. Note that some coalition  partners may  not define terminology similarly.\nEffects Terms and Task Verbs\n3.2. E\nffects : Effects are the change brought about in a target by the consequence of\naction or activity ; but may also be achieved by other effects. Effects are therefore the\ncommander’s desired outcome in relation to the enemy, population, terrain of friendly forces.Effects may be required in the physical domain, the cognitive domain, the virtual domain – or\nall three.\n•Planning: At the tactical level, an effect contributes to the achievement of anobjective. The different ways to achieve the effects will usually form the basis ofdiffering COAs.\noConcentrate on matching the right action to the intended effect.\noEffects can be created by one action or multiple actions. Like dominoes,effects can be created by other effects. Measuring effects using MOErequires subjective and objective analysis.\n•OSW : Within orders, effects are articulated in the commander’s intent , the\nScheme of Manoeuvre and in the unifying purpose of subordinates’ missions.\n3.3. Actions (or Task Verb ): An action or task verb , describes physical or observable\nactivities to cause the desired effect. All actions have consequences, some desired and\nsome undesired. Subordinates are directed to conduct specific actions to achieve desired\neffects\n•Planning: Actions are delivered using the 4 ‘levers’ of joint action (fires,\nmanoeuvre, information and CIMIC).\noActions are usually easier to meas ure/observe using MOP.\noIf\n the desired effect is not being achieved, then the action should be\nchanged.\n•OSW\n: Use actions to describe how effects are to be achieved.  Use task verbs in\nthe SoM\n and in mission statements.  Actions should never be described in the\nintent statement.  Only authorised actions terms should be used in order to aid\ncomprehension.  Actions should be written in full capitals to differentiate from\neveryday\n language.\n3.4. CSS Speci\nfic Effects/ Actions .

What is a Mission Statement ?  “A clear, concise statement of the task(s) to be \nperformed and the purpose of the mission. ” (AAP-6)  \nMISSION \nTask (What is to be done)  + Purpose (Why is it to be done)\n5.\n2. Task .  A task is something you have been told to do (specified) or must do (implied) \nto achieve the specified.  Tasks can be objectives, effects and actions.  Multiple tasks can be \ngiven to subordinates.  \n5.3. What is a Concept of Operations (CONOPS)?   “A clear and concise statement of \nthe line of action chosen by a commander in order to accomplish his given mission.”  (AAP-6)  \n5.4. Developing Mission Statements .   A mission statement is a clear and direct order \nto a subordinate and consists of Action / Task verbs and a unifying purpose (Effect), traditionally preceded by the words ‘in order to’. There are three  types of mission:  \n•A single statement with a unifying purpose. A superior commander should strive\nto give a minimum of tasks to each subordinate. Therefore the simplest type ofmission, and that usually most applicable at lower levels of command, contains only\none task.\n•A series of tasks with a unifying purpose . It is better to be explicit and list\nspecified tasks for subordinates with a unifying purpose.\n•For reserves, a series of ‘be prepared to’ (BPT) tasks, without a unifying purpose.\nAt the operational level a mission may be a mixture of all three types.  \n5.5. Use of Missions in OSW .  Missions should be listed in a logical order of activity \nrather than in service precedence as this will aid the visualisation of the operation. Tasks \ncontained within mission statements should be substantive.  Lesser tasks, such as \nconducting prelim moves or establishing liaison will normally be omitted from the mission, \nbut may be included elsewhere in the orders, normally in coordinating instructions.  Missions \nwill often be writ ten personally by the commander and  should contains the elements of who, \nwhat, when, wher e, and why.  \n5.6. Example: GOLD JTF Mission: \n“Support Gov of SOUTHLAND (GoS) in the restoration of territorial integrity, the deterrence \nof Red Alliance  influence and the defeat of NORTHLAND aggression in the border areas  in \norder to re -establish territorial integrity and create the conditions for long term stability in \nSOUTHLAND. \nTasks : \n1.Establish UK JTF in the JOA.\n2.In conjunction with military forces of SOUTHLAND, restore the sovereignty of\nSOUTHLAND.\n3.Where appropriate enhance military forces of SOUTHLAND capacity and capability\nto operate in the JOA without GOLD Alliance support.\n4.Lead with theatre STRATCOM.\n5.Protect security and freedom of movement of GOLD Interests in MAHHAR.\nSERIAL 3-04-05 \n3–04–05 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 6.BPT to conduct NEO of GOLD pers from the region in support of GOLD National\nEmbassies.\n7.Co-ordinate activity with GOLD National Embassies.\n5.\n7.

The MCC is to establish an early presence in the Indian Ocean  and \nSea of Oman in order to UNDERSTAND and DETER Red Alliance intervention, DISRUPT \nthreats from NORTHLAND, whilst  COERCING and if necessary be prepared to DEFEAT \nNORTHLAND maritime forces  in the JOA  in order to restore the territorial integrity of \nSOUTHLAND.   \nTasks: \n1.SUPPORT JTF Theatre entry and recovery.\n2.SECURE SLOCs within the JOA.\n3.MONITOR I&W of RED A lliance  and NORTHLAND activity.\n4.Contribute to JTF UNDERSTAND of JOA.\n5.Contribute to the Recognised Humanitarian Picture\n6.DETER RED ALLIANCE  from intervention in SOUTHLAND .\n7.As\nsist in the DEVELOP MENT of SOUTHLAND maritime forces .\n8.SUPPORT the JTF medical plan and MEDEVAC.\n9.SUPPORT LCC in MAHHAR through the provision of the Maritime Fires .\n10.UNDERSTAND and DISRUPT NORTHLAND maritime operations in the JOA.\n11.BPT ATTACK against signature NORTHLAND capabilities and in support LCC.\n12.BPT SUPPORT Isolated Personnel recovery.\n13.BPT PROTECT SO UTHLAND Critical National Infrastructure .\n14.BPT SCREEN and facilitate LCC withdrawal from MAHHAR.\n15.BPT SUPPORT NEO.\n16.BPT support in the repatriation of CPERS.\n5.\n8. LAND Tactical Mission s:  At the tactical level, ‘what a commander is to achieve’ is \ngiven to him in his mission, which should be described in terms of tasks, normally written as  \nobjectives, Effects, Actions or  Task verbs  (see 3 -03-03), with a unifying purpose.    \n5.\n9. Example Land Brigade Mission.  Mission with 2 tasks and a unifying purpose: \n19 Mech Bde is to DEFEND between Line OWL and Line EAGLE to: \n•Draw en into Obj LANCE.\n•Prevent en pen of Line EAGLE.\nIn order to set conditions for a Div Counter -attack.  \n5.10.  Example Land Unit Mission.  This unit level example has 3 tasks  with a unifying \npurpose and shows who , what , when, where , and why. \nKRH Battlegroup  (who)  (2,1).

Formulating Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) .  The concept of operations \ndescribes how the commander intends to achieve his mission.  It is drafted in the estimate \nprocess, steps 3 and 4.  It has three main elements:  \n•Intent Statement\n•Scheme of Manoeuvre\n•Main Effort.\nSERIAL 3-04-05 \n3–04–05 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 It can also have a statement of what the end -state is – normally only used at operational or \nhigher (component) tactical level.  \n5.12.  Intent Statement :  The commander’s effects schematic produced in step 2 of the \nestimate process  leads to the intent statement.  The intent statement should be written by \nthe commander personally to express what  he wants to achieve and why.  The intent must \nbe written in language that the reader will understand, noting that they may be from another \nnation or be civilian.  A possible sequence for writing an Intent is: \n•Purpose (Why)  - Describe the overall purpose of what it is you are trying to achiev e\n(\nthe Outcome).\n•Method (What)  - Describe the Objectives and the Effects using time , space or\npurpose to group them.\n•End-state  - Summarise what success looks like and indicate what next.\n5.13.  Number of Words .  Intent  statements at the lower tactical level, Land Brigade and \nbelow may be quite short and brief.  However, operational commander’s or component \ncommander’s Intents for campaigns will be considerably longer, as much as a full A4 sized \npage as the complexity and duration is much bigger.   Critically, The intent helps the force \npursue the mission without further orders, even when actions do not unfold as planned  and it \nenables exploitation when the execution unfolds more favourable than expected. Thus, if an \nunant icipated situation arises, participating commanders understand the purpose of the \nforthcoming action well enough to act decisively and within the bounds of the higher  \ncommander’s intent.  \n5.14.  Example Intent at Land Brigade  level : \n•I intend to enable the destruction of the enemy’s 80 (Sep) MR Bde by 20 Armd Bde.\n•We will FIND 80 (Sep) MR Bde axis of advance as early as possible, and DISRUP T\nhi\ns advance to EA TIGER.  BLOCK his lead echelons from exiting EA TIGER,\nthereby FIXING 80 (Sep) MR Bde so that it can be DESTROYED in detail.\n•At the end of this operation 80 (Sep) MR Bde will CLEARED from EA TIGER, and 4\nBde will begin its ADVANCE to the International Border.\n5.15.  Scheme of Manoeuvre (SoM) :  The SoM expands the Intent; to describe how the \ncommander sees his operation unfolding.  SoM  sets out  the method to achieve the change \nidentified in the Intent.  It explains the additional detail of how , in relation to each other, the \nforce’s  subordinate elements are to achieve the overall  purpose .  It is vital that  subordinates \ncan understand their roles in the plan; what actions they need to accomplish and the effects \nthat they and others are to realise.  Because it is related to time, a SoM can only be \ncompleted once the Sync Matrix has been confirmed.  A clear intent should minimise the \nlength of the SoM.    \n5.16.  Main Effort (ME):   The ME is that activity that the commander considers crucial to \nthe success of the mission. He must give it substance by allocating sufficient resources to \nthe unit assigned to it. Illuminating the ME ensures that when the situation becomes more \nconfusing that activity will be remembered and provide the rallying point of effort. ME may  \nchange throughout an operation. It should be expressed as an action together, if possible,  \nwith the  primary force undertaking it.  \n5.17.  Example JTF Main Effort : \n•Phase 1:  Successful deterrence of further NORTHLAND aggression. (ACC)\n•Phase 2:  Restoration of territorial integrity of SOUTHLAND. (LCC)\n•Phase 3:  Successful hand- over for sole security responsibility to an increasingly\nconfident and capable SOUTHLAND Armed Forces.

This SOHB Serial combines the theory of how to plan a briefing to \ncommunicate  information along with the agenda and format of a number of common \nbriefings.  \nEffective Communication  Overview  \n6.2. Good commanders and staff officers have the attributes to be able to think and \ndecide, organise, and communicate. The most visible skill a staff officer possess is that of \ncommunication. The best plans and ideas will matter little if poorly communicated. S imilarly, \nthe best presenter or writer will be unable to ‘sell’ a poorly thought through plan.    \n6.3. If your communication is going to be worth the effort, then it must be effective. What \ndo we mean by Effective Communication? Put simply:  \n• ‘Effective Communication is defined as the ability to convey information to \nanother effectively and efficiently. ’  \nIf the communication is effective, it will have met its purpose, have been clearly understood \nand can be acted upon. If it is efficient, it will make best use of your time and the time of the \naudience. As the originator, this responsibility lies with you.  It is a process about knowing \nwhat is required, finding, and gathering the information to meet the requirement and then \nconveying the information clearly and simply. It is much more than just exchanging \ninformation.  \n6.4. Communication comes in many forms: it could be a presentation to an audience to \ninform; it could be a written briefing to senior officer to seek a decision; it may be a briefing \nfrom a flipchart to explain, and there are many other examples.  \n6.5. For any type of communication, we should always apply the POWER principle:  \n• Plan. \n• Organise . \n• Write. \n• Edit. \n• Review/Rehearse . \nPlan .  (See Planning Sheet at below  which you should use to aid planning ) \n6.6. Timings .  The first thing we must do is establish how much time we have.  First \nestablish by when, date and time, the requirement is due. When you have a total time break \nthis time down into thirds:  \n• 1/3 of the time to Plan  and Organise ,  \n• 1/3 to Write  and  \n• 1/3 to Edit and Review/Rehearse . \n• You also need to know for a verbal brief/presentation, how long have you got to \nspeak for and is there a questions and answer session too.  \n6.7. Planning Questions .  To understand what the requirement is, some important \nquestions need to be answered. Use the 5W and H method:  \n• When? – see above which you have now answered!  \n• Where? - If a presentation or a verbal brief, where do you have to be? If a piece \nof written communication, who does it need to be with?  \n• What? – What do they want to know? Have you been asked any questions?  \n• Why? - Why do they want to know? What are they going to do with the \ninformation?  \nSERIAL 3-04-06 \n3–04–06 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20 • Who? Who is the communication for? Who are the audience? What does the \naudience already know?  \n• How? What are your initial thoughts on headings/sections/ideas/topics, etc.  \n6.8. Organise .  After planning you now need to organise your thoughts and your \nreference material. If you have references or source information read these through and \nidentify which parts are helpful to meeting the purpose of the task, which parts provide \ninformation w ithin the key headings.  Which information provides answers to any questions \nyou have been asked. You will have more information that you need. You will not be able to \ncover everything so you must decide what to include and what not! The choice can  be \nhelped by categorising information by applying the MOSCOW  principle:  \n• Musts : these items must be included, without which the audience cannot \nunderstand what your communication is about.  (These are the few things you \nwould tell them if you had only two minutes to make them understand.)   \n• Shoulds : they really ought to know these things if they need to understand the \nsubject properly.  \n• Coulds : these are nice to know but can be left out and, if your audience is for a \nsenior officer, they should always be left out.  \n• Will Nots : information that may be relevant to the topic but does not meet the \npurpose of the communication identified in the planning.  \nCross reference the list of Must, Should, Coulds and Will Nots with the available reference \nmaterial to meet your purpose. Identify a logical structure which meets the requirement – the \nquestions answered in the plan. This should present the identified Mus t and Should \ninformation in a way which will make sense to the audience. Present the most important \ninformation first - if there is more than one Must or Should arrange them by importance. Only \nafter you have Planned and Organised  should you start to write . \n6.9. Write .  In Writing  the detail is added to the structure developed during Planning  and \nOrganisation . With a piece of written communication start to draft the paragraphs under the \nstructure you have developed. With a verbal brief or presentation, always develop the points \nyou are going to talk about before you start to consider how you will illustrate th em. Do not  \nbe tempted to start to design slides or a briefing aid before you have understood the points \nyou are going to make. All types of communication should have a Beginning, Middle and \nEnd. This is a standard convention and the audience you are commun icating will be \nexpecting the information to come in these three parts.  \n• The beginning .  This  should explain what the communication is about and \ndefine its purpose. The audience need this made clear to them. The audience \nshould understand what will follow and also why they should be listening to you \nor reading your document in the first place.  \n• The middle  details the main points you wish to cover – your Musts and Shoulds. \nMake your most important points first. Within each heading or section make your \nmost important point first too.  \n• The end should convey your key message again. But it may also convey where \nto go from here, what next.  \n• Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity . In general,  when you communicate, whether \nwritten or verbal, it should follow the convention of Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity \nor A B C:  \n• Accuracy  - the information given must be reliable, and you must take care to \ndistinguish fact from opinion.  \nSERIAL 3-04-06\n3–04–06 - 3\nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20•Brevity .  Focus on the key points identified from your Musts and Shoulds.\nThose who you are providing the communication for, usually senior officers, will\nnot have time to read long documents or sit through long presentations.\n•Clarity .  Use simple language presenting the material as clearly as possible.\nUse language and structure to allow for quick understanding. Your audience\nshould be able to understand the first time they read or hear a presentation.\n• Language .  To enhance A B C – choose your language carefully. Choose clear,\neveryday words in simple sentence structures within short paragraphs,\nappropriate for the audience. Use correct, spoken English or Arabic and avoid\ntechnical language, jargon, acronyms, abbre viations, abstractions and\nmeaningless corporate -speak. Often one carefully chosen word can do the job of\na phrase, or a phrase can replace a sentence. We communicate clearly because\nwe think clearly, and we think clearly because we communicate clearly.  C lear,\nprecise language not only helps us to communicate, but it also ensures that\nwe’ve got our own thinking properly sorted out.  Vague statements such as\n‘issues around’ hide muddled thinking and communicate an imprecise message.\nWe must think matters t hrough to make sure we’re saying exactly what we\nmean. For example, how much more informative are phrases such as will\nincrease, will damage, will reduce, will complicate than is the widely used ‘will\nimpact’ upon?\n• Question as you Draft . As we write, it’s helpful to imagine a sceptical senior\nofficer or audience repeatedly asking us two simple questions: Says who?  So\nwhat?  The first reminds us to present some convincing and punchy evidence to\nsupport our arguments.  The second forces u s to pursue the logic of what we’re\nsaying through to a precise and concrete conclusion, often revealing the solid,\npractical advantage of our recommendation.\n6.10. Edit.  There is always a temptation to steal some of the last 1/3 of the time available\n–which should be used for Editing , Reviewing and Rehearsing, to assist with writing. Be\ndisciplined. Protect the last 1/3 of your time, it will improve the quality of your product no end.\nA senior officer can always tell if you have not left enough time to first Edit and then\nReview/Rehears e your work. Editing is a distinct phase of the process – it focuses on the\ncontent . It provides that opportunity to ensure the poin ts made are as concise and precise as\npossible.\n• Check MOSCOW .  Stand -back from the detailed process of writing and take a\nfresh look at the content. Look at the Must and Should information again. Now\nthe words are drafted do these bits of information remain Musts and Shoulds? If\nnot, re -order them accordingly and b e ruthless.\n• Review A, B, C .\n•Accuracy  – ensure the information is factually accurate. Leave out any\ninformation that you are not sure about, or if it is critical, confirm that information\nbefore including it. It is OK not to know something but to communicate\ninformation that is plain wrong is  inexcusable.\n•Brevity  – ensure every word is required to communicate the points made . Go\nthrough each line and check that the words used are necessary. Remove those\nwords that add no value.\n•Clarity  – check the words convey the intended meaning. Keep the language\nsimple and the sentences short and to the point. Put yourself in the audience’s\nposition – is it clear?\nSERIAL 3-04-06\n3–04–06 - 4\nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20At the end of the editing process, you will have improved the quality of your work. You\nwill have improved not just the language but the sense and understand. This is time\nwell spent and will add value to any communication you are drafting.\n6.11. Review/Rehearse .  The final part of preparation is to Review and Rehearse . Editing  \nlooks specificall y at what i s said and written. Reviewing i s different.\n• Review  looks at whether the intended purpose has been met. To review, go\nback to the key questions you asked in the planning phase and check against\nthese:\n•Who?  - Who is the communication for? What do they know already? Have\nyou made allowances for what the audience knows already – don’t repeat what\nthey already know.\n•Why?  - Why do they want to know – what is the purpose? Does what you\nhave prepared meet the overall purpose? What is the senior officer intending to\ndo with the information? Is what you have prepared useful to the senior officer\nbased on the purpose?\n•What?  - What do they want to know? If they have asked you specific\nquestions – have you answered them ? If they have asked you for an opinion –\nhave you given it and is it clear it is your opinion and not fact?\nBy taking time to review, you are confirming you have met the key criteria you have\nbeen asked to produce. You should have confidence to know that you have met the\nkey requirements. Don’t ever overlook reviewing your work.\n• Rehearsal . If delivering a verbal communication,  you will have to rehearse. If a\npresentation you should book time and a space to rehearse. If it is a briefing for a\nsenior officer, as a staff officer, you may not be able to rehearse away from your\ndesk. That does not matter, if you must, rehearse at yo ur desk. Even if you get to\nrehearse just once, it will be worth it. Use the opportunity to align what you are\ngoing to say to any briefing aids you may use, maps, diagrams etc and ensure\nyou stick to the tim e you have got. Use some of the rehearsal time to run through\nyour responses to questions you may receive – just two or three of the most\nlikely will do.\n• Answering Questions .  Different types of communication require different ways\nto answer questions.\n•Presentations . When giving a presentation to an audience a useful way to\nanswer questions is:\n•Stand still – walking around reduces confidence in the answer.\n•Actively Listen - look at the person who posed the question.\n•Paraphrase the question so all can hear.\n•Thank the asker.\n•Handle the question – give a concise answer.\n•Verify with the asker you have answered their question.\n•Verbal Brief . After delivering a verbal briefing a focussed way to provide a\nuseful answer is:  What – So What – Now What\n•What  – answer the question posed.\n•So What  – what was the outcome, what happened because of the\nanswer to the question.\n•Now What  – what does this all mean for the future.\nSERIAL 3-04-06\n3–04–06 - 5\nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 206.12.  Key Points :\n• For any type of communication to any type of audience – use P O W E R  to\nmake your communication more effective.\n• After you have determined when the information is due (and where), allow 1/3 of\nthe time to plan and organise, 1/3 to write and 1/3 to edit and review/rehearse.\n• When Planning:\n•Apply the 5W an H .\n•Ask yourself  some key questions – What information do they want to know?\nWho wants it? What are they going to do with it? Who are the audience? And\nwhat do they already know?\n• When Organising:\n•Prioritise your information using the MOSCOW  principle:\n•Retain the Musts and Shoulds – don’t include the Coulds.\n•Present your most important  points first.\n• When Writing:\noEvery communication needs a Beginning, Middle and End.\noEnsure what you write is Accurate, Brief and Clear.\noSelect the appropriate language  for the audience.\n• When Editing:\noFocus on the content:\n•Edit for MOSCOW ; are the Musts and Shoulds in the right place still?\n•Edit for A B C  – reduce your words down to what is the minimum\nrequired to be effective.\n• When Reviewing/Rehearsing:\noReview what you have written against the key questions from your planning –\nhave you met the purpose?\noIf a verbal brief or presentation – rehearse.\noIf you are expecting questions think about you could be asked and think about\nanswers.\n6.13. Written Brief Format – IRTB.   If writing a written brief as part of the Write element  \nof POWER , a useful format to present information to a senior officer i s the IRTB format or\nIssue, Recommendation, Timing and Background.  IRTB describe s the key heading s of the\nwritten brief.  All the content under each heading will have been identified in the Plan and\nOrganise parts of POWER before the Write element. Th e IRTB format should be use d as\ndescribed below:\na. Beginning .  The beginning contains the Title of the document and the Issue.\nThe Title should cover the theme of the brief and should not be the same as the\nIssue.  The Issue is very specific  it is a short sentence to present the Issue to the\nreader:\nIf the written brief is to inform the Issue should be phrased:\n‘To inform you, To update you  on the …[here insert to Issue] .’\nSERIAL 3-04-06\n3–04–06 - 6\nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20If the written brief is seeking a decision from the reader then the Issue should be\nphrased:\n‘Whether/ Which [insert organisation or person] could/should [insert action for\nwhich decision is being sought].\nb. Middle .   The middle of the written brief cover the Recommendations, Timing\nand Background.\n•Reco mmendations .   Th e recommendation (s) are put in a s the very next\nheading , it is effectively a BLUF, which recommends to the reader what to do.\nThis is important , as the reader understand s from the very start what you are\nasking them to do.  They  can read the rest of the brief with the\nrecommendations in mind.   The Recommendations paragraph is written as\nfollows:\nRecommendations .   [Insert appointment of the person you are writing\nthe brief for ] is requested to:\na.Note. [State the current situation around the issue  – this is drawn\nfrom your analysis in the Background p aragraphs]\nb.Agree. [If you are seeking a decision include the decision you are\nseeking  - if there is no decision remove this paragraph]\n•Timing .   You must indicate to the reader how long they have to make a\ndecision .  This is expressed a s one word, followed by an explanation of the\nimportance of the timing.   The timing is  either : Urgent  (if a decision is required\nthat day); Priority (if a decision is needed in 3 working days) ; Routine (if\nlonger than 3 days).  For example :\nTiming .  Priority .  A decision is required by tomorrow in time for the\nBoard meeting  the following day .\n•Background .   The Background paragraph is normal ly a number of separate\nparagraphs  and sub paragraphs  which contain key information about the\nissue and what factors have led to your recommendation.  Only include the\nMusts and Shoulds.  If seeking a decision, identify problems, solutions and\nthe factual  basis for action.  Here you should include arguments for and\nagainst courses of action.\nc. End.

The Oncoming Staff Brief is designed to ensure that all\nrelevant information is passed between staff on shift change.\n• CONOPS Brief . The CONOPS Brief is delivered by the staff or a commander (to\nhis superior) and outlines a COA using the principal headings of an OpO. It\nencompasses elements of both a Decision and Information Brief - the superior\ncommander may approve or reject the CON OPS, or seek further clarification. It\nalso allows for the opportunity to request additional resources.\n• Ops Room Visitor Brief . This situation brief is intended for briefing of visitors to a\nHQ or ops room.\n• Ops Update Brief . The Ops Update Brief is a brief given mid -operation to ensure\nSituational Awareness is maintained within the staff cells of a HQ.\n• Storyboard . Storyboards are usually a post -incident analysis tool which pictorially\nrepresents an event in time and space. It is prepared by the staff on behalf of the\ncommander and allows him to rapidly assimilate information of a complex nature.\nStoryboards may al so be used to assist in briefing decisions to be taken (for\nexample during the Targeting Process).\nDetailed Briefing Format Examples:\n6.16.

What is an Orders Group (O GROUP) ?  An Orders Group is the method a \ncommander uses to give oral (spoken) orders to his subordinates.  Commanders will usually \nprefer to issue orders in person so that they can impose their will and personality on their \nsubordinates, emphasise key points and allow subordinates to ask any questions \nimmediately.   It is usual for attendees at verbal O Groups to receive printed OSW and traces \nfrom the Higher HQ.   \n7.2. Rehearsals.  An orders group is a stage managed affair. Therefore a rehearsal is \ndesirable if not always practical.  \n7.3. Reception Arrangements. The bigger the headquarters , the more important the \nreception arrangements for those attending the O Gp. In particular consider:  \n• Arrangements for arrivals from outside the headquarters, including guidance on \nwhere to  park and how to get to the O Gp.  \n• Reception arrangements at the O Gp site. For example:  \no When those attending will be allowed access to the site.  \no Arrangements to meet early arrivals.  \no A location for copying of traces and marking maps, and for subordinates to \nread written  orders prior to receipt of oral orders. Ideally the HQ will already \nhave prepared traces and OSW for subordinates.  \n7.4. Requirements of Those Attending.  Consider the requirements of those attending \nthe O Gp. In particular:  \n• Where personal equipment can be stowed during their time at the headquarters.  \n• Drinks and meals.  \n• Communication facilities.  \n7.5. Seating Plan.  Although the commander may have his own views on where specific \nindividuals are to sit, the general principle is for the main subordinate commanders to sit \ncentrally at the front while other individuals, including the staff, sit at the sides. Considerat ion \nshould be given to:  \n• The availability, number and marking of seats:  \n• Displaying a seating plan.  \n7.6. Aids .  The aids used at an O Gp will vary. Consider the requirement for a marked \nmap, model or diagram, the need for documents, including confirmatory notes, task organisations and the use of PowerPoint (and the availability of reversionary methods should \npower  fail). \n7.7. Post O Gp.   After the O Gp staff cells may use the opportunity to amplify areas of the \norders with subordinate specialists who may have attended the O Gp with their commander  \neg the Engineer or Fires commander .  Staff should be careful not to use up the subordinates’ \n‘2/3’ of planning time in doing so.

What is LOG KEEPING ?  The log is a record of all activities, all information received  \nand all decisions taken by the HQ.  This detail is recorded either electronically or on a log \nsheet.  All operational messages must be logged and acknowledged by a watchkeeper and the information passed to those concerned, both inside and outside the CP. Watchkeepers themselves must understand the commander’s intent and be able to analyse, interpret and \nact on information received.  \n8.2. Accurate Records .  The importance of accurate and comprehensive log -keeping \ncannot be overstressed; logs may be required for after action analysis and could be \nparticularly relevant in other operations.  The detail on the operations log should be \ncirculated within the CP at formation level and above.  The need for a hard copy of the log to \nbe passed around a CP will be reduced as more information is stored digitally. The following items should be included in the log:  \n•The gist of all radio and telephone conversations, with exact local time and date\ngroup.\n•All written messages and reports (hard copy only), both in and out of the HQ.  A l\nong\nm\nessage may be paraphrased or referred to by file reference and subject.\n•Reports from LOs and visitors and any other relevant information received.\n•The time of issue of OSW, and the times of dispersal of conferences and orders\ngroups.\n•The movements of the commander and senior staff officers.\n•Own or enemy action. Items to be included in SITREPs and the commander’s diaryto be written up effectively from the log.\n•Any other significant action such as those of non- military agencies.\nThe bare facts of events recorded in the log can be obscure to a reader unless they are in close touch with the situation. Time and mental effort can be saved by recording ‘comment’ in the action column of the log to underline the significance of a particular item and by \nmarking up items which are likely to be included in the compilation of OWNSITREPs or \nCOMBATREPs.  \n8.3. What are Reports & R eturns (R2) ?  Reports and Returns are the routine flow of \ninformation up and down the chain of command, normally tied to the battle rhythm and \ninformation requirements that have  been established to support the particular \noperation/campaign.  There is no standard R2 battle rhythm across Defence or NATO.  The format of reports will be set out in the HQ Standard Operating Instructions.  \n8.4. Example Types of R2 Include: \nSITREP  Situation Report  LOGSITREP  Logistic Situation \nReport  \nINTREP  Intelligence report  ESREP  Equipment Report  \nCOMBATREP  Combat report  ASSESREP  Assessment Report  \nINCREP  Incident Report  PERSREP  Personnel Report  \nSINCREP  Significant Incident Report  ENGREP  Engineer Report  \nSERIAL 3-05- 01 \n3–05– 01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 ILLUSTRATIVE STRATEGIC MILITARY OPERATIONS DIRECTIVE  FORMAT  \nFormat based on UK Staff work .

The Campaign Plan : describes the nature of the crises from both strategic and \noperational level perspectives; sets out the strategic intent for the campaign; and provides \nthe Joint Task Force Commander’s (JTFC’s) intent in terms of what is to be achieved in \norder to succes sfully reach the campaign end- state. The Campaign Plan  is ‘owned’ by the \nJTFC although it will be influenced by others, particularly the Joint Commander (Jt Comd) \nand the Military Strategic Commander. It is the core document from which should stem all \nsubs equent planning and execution by the Joint Force.  \n2. The Campaign Plan  provides the JTFC’s Concept of Operations (CONOPS); this is \nfounded on those decisive conditions deemed necessary to achieving the campaign \nobjectives. Subsequent Operation Plans (OPLANs) and Joint Coordination Orders (JCO) (A \nJCO is a Joint Operation Orders(OPORDs) ) will address the supporting effects and activities \n(missions, tasks and purposes) that are required to achieve each of the decisive conditions.  \n3. In short duration campaigns, the JTFC may replace this  Campaign PLAN CONOPS  \nwith an OPLAN.  \nSITUATION  \n[This section is derived from Step 1 of the Operational Estimate –  Analysis products may be \nincluded as Annexes].  \n4.

[This should focus on what it\nis that the Joint Force is to achieve in order to reach the campaign end- state – set in t he\nc\nontext of the desired outcome.

In\nthis manner, component commanders can anticipate their role inside the Campaign Plan and\nplay an active role in developing appropriate OPLANs and JCO s. The Scheme of\nManoeuvre within the JTFC’s Campaign Plan  should be enduring; it will be subject to\nperiodic campaign effectiveness assessment.

It is the principal method by which a JTFC makes his\noverall intent clear to his subordinates and is usually supported by the allocation ofresources in order to give substance to that which he considers crucial to the success\nof his mission. Aware of a JTFC’s main effort and priorities, subordinate commanders\ncan take timely and independent action in fast -moving and changeable operations,\nthereby optimising tempo. A JTFC’s main effort is likely to change over time. In his\nSERIAL 3-05-04\n3–05–04 - 5\nOrig\ninal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020Campaign Plan, a JTFC may wish to highlight those decisive conditions that, above\nothers, will attract ‘main effort’ status].\nRISK\n17.

The JTF has deployed into a complex environment and faces a\nbroad spectrum of threats from a near peer adversary, capable of using conventional forc e\nand ex\nploiting multiple asymmetric levers in a sophisticated hybrid strategy.  Reporti ng\ni\nndicates that GLF also intends to directly target foreigners in ADEN , particularly GOLD\nnationals.

Codewords for which there is a cont need, as opposed to those specific to the op covered \nby the opO, should be incl in the CEI and not in the opO.  Thus codewords for the con of STAP \nstages and EMCON should be given in the CEI.  \n \nc. List in chronological sequence of use.  \n \nd. Codewords are issued to fmns by MOD for use when required and are not to be invented \nlocally.  Once used they may not be repeated.  \n \ne. To prevent repetition on different radio nets, lower fmns select different words from own \nlists for meanings which they require in their own orders.  Exception to this rule is for res dmls, \nwhere the same words are used at all levels of comd to avoid confusion when auth is delegated.  \n \n29. Acknowledgement .  It is normally desirable to require acknowledgement of an opO.  It may \nbe nec to specify which fmns and units are to acknowledge.  \n \n30. Signature Block .  The signature block is to be that of either the comd or his principal SO auth \nto sign for the  comd (COS), showing appt in each case.  The original copy of the order is to be \nsigned by comd or his COS as fol:  \n \n ............     or ...............  \n Maj Gen    Col \n Comd 1 (UK) Armd Div  for Comd 1 (UK) Armd Div  \n \nIf comd  or COS signs a master copy, use of which permits automatic repro of doc with signature \nthereon, no authentication is required.

Authentication .  If neither comd or COS are aval to sign the opO at the time of issue, comd’s name \nis typed and a SO authenticates order, comd or COS signing original/file copy of opO at earliest \nopportunity.  In this case neither comd nor COS were aval so opO has been authenticated and comd \nwould sign file copy on return.  Had the COS been aval, no authentication would be nec, and he would \nsign for comd using his own signature block.\n32. Annexes .  Annexes are lettered alphabetically in capitals, A, B, C etc and may have one or more \nappx numbered in arabic numerals.  Annexes must be referred to in appropriate part of  main body of \nopO.  (see also Note 35).\n33. Distr .  The distr is to show copy nos of order issued to each addressee.  Where annexes are issued \non a different scale from main body of order, a separate distr list will be required as part of each annex so \nissued.\na. The list is set out in normal sequence external action addressees, external info addressees, \ninternal action addressees, internal info addressees.  The distr, taking into account ‘need to know’, \nshould incl:\n(1\n)All fmns, unit or sub- units directly subordinate to originating comd.\n(2\n)Each sp arms/svc organic to, sp of originating HQ.\n(3\n)RN/RAF units coop.\n(4\n)Higher fmns, flanking fmns.\n(5\n)Own comd and staff, file, comd’s diary and spare.\nb. Copies for sp arms and svcs are addressed to that arm or svc, eg ‘Comms’, when a sp arm \nadviser, head of svc or svc rep is organic, or permanently att to originating HQ.  If no such rep exists \ncopies are addressed to appropriate arm or svc units.  Senio r comd or rep of each sp arm/svc is \nresponsible for distr to all elms of his arm/svc as nec.\n34. N\notes on Example .\na. Nos of Copies .  Sufficient copies should be given to avoid unnec repro by subordinate HQs, \neg bdes, Arty, Engr and Comms have 2 copies each (one for Step Up).  Bdes, Arty and Engr will \nproduce opOs of their own and there is little pt in giving them copies for each unit.  Some addressees \nmay need ext ra copies of particular annexes, eg  Mov Table for Pro.  Nevertheless, distr of whole \norder, and of individual annexes, should be kept to a sensible min, eg all addressees would not need \nAnnexes D and E (but see Note 34c).\nb. PCS.  Although rep at Div HQ, PCS will receive detail they need from G1/G4 staff and do not \nneed full opO.\nc. Distr of Annexes .  Annex C is ‘to fol’ and Annexes D and E have a different distr to main opO. \nAll 3 annexes will therefore need to be made out as separate docs with their own separate distr.\nSERIAL 3-06-02 \n \n \n3-06-02 - 10 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \nInternal:  \n \nAction:  \n \nStep Up HQ  12 \nRear HQ  13 \nArty 14-15 \nEngr  16-17 \nComms  18-19 \nAvn 20 \nLog Sp  21 \nMed 22 \nES 25 \nG1/G4  26 \nG2/G3  27 \nG3 (Air)  28 \n \nInfo: \n \nComd  29 \nFile 30 \nComd’s Diary  31 \nSpare 32-34 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 of 10  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSERIAL 3-06-02 \n \n \n3-06-02 - 11 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \n       ANNEX A TO \n       OPS 13  \n       DATED    JAN 1 X \n \nNICKNAMES  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA1 of 1  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n  \n  \n35.

An annex may take form of a trace, overlay, overprinted map, sketch, plan or table.  \n \nc. Annexes issued with, and in same no as main order, need only be suitably ident in \nrespect of the main order.  They must also contain a protective marking.  \n \nd.

Introduction .  Overlay O rders  are the combination of written and graphic instructions \non one trace containing enough info for a commander to carry out his specified tasks.  \n3.2. General .  When producing an overlay OpO the maximum amount of information \nshould be represented graphically.  The recipient of an order should be able to place the \ntrace onto his map and then ‘fight’ from it.  The temptation to produce too much information \nmust b e resisted.  The following are only guidelines as production of an overlay OpO \nultimately entails subjective judgement by author.  Overlays may be produced electronically  \non command systems , as ‘clears’, with or without a map background (‘taciprint’ ) or on paper.  \n3.3. General Rules . \na. The author must be free to put on overlay what he deems necessary.  The \noverlay should show the situation as commander intends/expects it to be when the \noperation is carried out rather than current situation. The difference between ‘actual’ \nand ‘projected’  dispositions must be made clear.  \nb. The order may be issued by any suitable method.  \nc. The written part of order must follow the same sequence as formal written orders \nand can be produced in manuscript.  \nd. The requirements of speed normally dictate that overlays are handwritten and in \nonly one colour.  With increased use of digital networks, a combination of typewritten \ntext and handwritten or computer -generated graphics may prove a useful alternative \nprovided speed is not sacrificed.  \ne. A logical way to proceed is to complete graphical overlay first.  It is then easy to \nsee what must be included, in addition to the required sections, in the written portion of \nthe order either because it has proved difficult to portray or it will cause too much \nclutter on overlay.  \n3.4. The Overlay .  The completed overlay should be a distillation of all information \navailable to the commander when carrying out the specific task.  Those points which cannot \nreadily be transposed to graphics or which would obscure either map or trace detail should \nbe wr itten at the side.  Some particular points to note are:  \na. Task Organisation .  Shown diagrammatically anywhere on the overlay.  The ‘No \nchanges except’ method should be used if possible.   \nb. Enemy.  Information may be given on the overlay, on a separate overlay or by \nreference to other documents such as INTSUMs.  Information which cannot be \ndepicted should be written down.  \nc. Friendly Forces .  Information concerning friendly forces other than those \ncovered by the order, but which affects action of subordinate commanders, can either \nbe drawn on overlay or stated in the written portion.   \nd. Mission.  Originator’s mission must always be stated in writing.  \ne. Colon.  \n(1) A colon (:) indicates that detail relevant to subject is included in the \ngraphics.

The aim of an overlay OpO is to provide a quick set of simple orders \noutlining a commander’s concept of operations and missions for his subordinate \ncommanders.  The shorter time from warning order to despatch the more likely the operation \nis to be a success.  Simplicity and speed will enhance security.  \n3.7. Example.  Example of overlay order is below .

FRAGOs are an abbreviated form of opO.  They may be used in 3 ways:  \n• To issue timely changes to existing orders.  This is the most commonly used form \nof a FRAGO.  \n• To issue key sects of an order before the complete order has been produced.  \n• To provide specific instructions to command ers who do not require the complete \norder.  \n4.2. The standard OpO sequence and paragraph headings are used.  However, after the \nheadings, parts of the order which are unchanged or not essential are omitted.  In a FRAGO \nissued to amend existing orders it will be usual for the mission  to remain unchanged but for \nthe subordinates’ tasks to be amended to reflect new developments in the situation .  If the \nsituation has changed to the extent that the mission  has changed the issue of a FRAGO \nwould be inappropriate and a new OpO should be issued.  \n4.3. Gen written FRAGOs should fol low the normal conventions of operational  SD and the \nrules governing the production of OpOs/overlay OpOs.  There are 2 exceptions:  \n• The superscription of a schematic FRAGO can fol any reasonable format (see \nexample at Serial 14.  \n• The text of a FRAGO disseminated by sig should be in capitals throughout.  \n4.4. FRAGOs can be issued in schematic rather than overlay form to allow the order to be \nproduced in A4 size.  This facilitates transmission by fax.  Alternatively, electronic mail (E -\nMail) may be used.  \n4.5. In the examples that fol low, distribution lists have been cut short to save space.  \nSERIAL 3-06-04 \n3–06–04 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 DTG: 211400C FEB 11  \nFROM: 7 ARMD BDE MAIN  \nTO: SCOTS DG \n1 RRF \n4 REGT AAC  \nINFO: 1 (UK) ARMD DIV MAIN  \n4 ARMD BDE MAIN  \nOPS 13  \nFRAGO 3/9X: CHANGE TO OPO 5/9X  \nTask Org:  SCOTS DG  (3,1) OPCON 7 BDE    from 4 BDE    WEF 242100C until 271200C. \n4 Regt AAC ( -) OPCON 7 BDE   from 1  DIV   WEF 250200C until  260800 C. \n1.

The state of comd, both op comd and admin \ncomd, must be shown for log units but only admin comd status will usually be \nnec for other non-log units.  These log units are listed in the precedence of their \nstate of op comd and, within these categories, by their state of admin comd.  \nState of op comd takes precedence over state of admin comd eg: OPCOM and UCDM, OPCON and UCADMIN, TACON and UCDM.  \n \n(5) Residual Responsibility for Dets.

The residual responsibility remains with the parent fmn; eg had 110 Sqn RLC(V) been OPCOM and UCADMIN \n1(UK) Div, the det of one tp to TACON and UCDM ARRC would still leave 1(U K) \nDiv responsible for all admin matters less daily maint of that det tp.  \n \n(6) States of Comd .

Complete transfer of admin comd; when a fmn or unit \nis placed under comd of another fmn for admin, ie all svcs, med and pers \nmatters.  In this instance the fmn/unit’s parent fmn HQ has no residual \nadmin responsibility.  \n \n(b) UCADMIN Less .  When the temporary nature of the transfer \nmakes it unnec to eff a complete  change of admin comd, a fmn or unit \nmay be placed under comd for certain specified matters, or UCADMIN less \ncertain specified matters, eg UCADMIN less sup and routine G1 matters  \nfrom 191000 Jan.  (NB ‘Less sup’ does not affect sup responsibility for \ndaily maint as defined below.)  \n (c) UCDM .  When a fmn or unit is transferred for so short a time that it \nis placed under admin comd of the new fmn for daily maint only, its parent \nfmn HQ retains full responsibility for all other admin matters.

Times at which states are \neff will not nec be the same as an opO and its related CSSO (eg, if the CSSO \nwere produced significantly later than the opO, a unit which came ‘under  \nOPCOM forthwith’ in the opO might be ‘remaining UCADMIN’ in the CSSO).  \nNor is it always desirable for admin comd to change at the same time as op \ncomd.  Ideally admin comd should change during quiet periods in the replen \ncycle and therefore as a principle ni would be a bad time.  \n \n(9) OpO.  Units may sometimes be mentioned in the ‘Atts and Dets’ sub para \nof a CSSO, although they did not appear in the opO.  This is because the sub \npara is concerned only with admin atts and dets, and responsibility for admin is \nnot necessarily linked directl y with op comd.  \n \nb. Changes in Admin Comd . \n \n(1) It is not nec to show changes here if they are covered under ‘Log Task \nOrg’, but they should be incl if this is considered to help the clarity of the order.  \n \n(2) Only changes to existing admin arrangements at the level of the fmn \ninitiating the CSSO are incl, eg in a div CSSO  there is no need to mention the switching of a BG between bdes within the div, but a TA bn to the div changing \nfrom UCDM 1(UK) Div to UCADMIN 1(UK) Div would be.  \n \n11. Msn.  This is a statement of the admin aim.  If possible it should show the phase of \nops or period covered by the order, however lack of time will probably preclude the \nproduction of separate CSSOs for separate phases.  \n \n12. Gen.  Give the outline of admin plan incl a log task org and admin tfc circulation plan \n(which may be issued as an overlay).  It should include an admin/log ‘Concept of Ops’ sub para which compares with the equivalent sub para in an opO and might incl such pts as:  \n \n a. Overall log plan.  \n \nb. Log Task Org .  The Log Task Org only needs to show changes to op and admin \ncomd status of log units and changes in admin comd of others.

The \ndistr, taking into account ‘need to know’, should incl:  \n \n(1) All fmns, bdes, units or sub- units directly subordinate to the originating \ncomd, or for which the issuing comd has dir admin responsibility.  At div level \nthis incl all organic armd regts and armd inf bns, even if under comd a bde.  (See \nsub para c bel ow). \n \n(2) Each sp arm or svc organic to or sp the originating HQ.  \n \n(3) RN/RAF units coop or for which issuing HQ has admin responsibility.  \n \n(4) Higher fmn, flanking fmns.  \n \n(5) Own comd and staff, comd’s diary and spare.  \n \nb. Copies for sp arms and svcs are addressed simply to that arm or svc, eg \n‘Comms’, when a sp arms adviser, head of svc or svc rep is organic or permanently \natt to the originating HQ.  If no such permanent rep exists copies are addressed to \nthe appropriate  arm or svc units.  The senior comd or rep of each sp arm or svc is \nresponsible for distr to all other elms of his arm or svc as nec.  \n \nc. If no bde CSSO is to be issued, BGs are incl on the distr of the div CSSO   If \nhowever a bde CSSO is to be issued the normal chain of comd applies, and units \n(except for those which are Div Tps) would be omitted from the distr list.  \n \n28. Explanatory Notes on Example.  \n \na. Nos of Copies .  Sufficient copies should be  given to avoid unnec repro by \nsubordinate HQs, eg bdes and Comms have 2 copies each (one for Step Up) while Arty have enough to issue copies to regts under comd.  Some addressees may also \nneed extra copies of particular annexes: Log Sp, Med and ES will require addl copies \nfor each sub unit.  Nevertheless, distr of the whole order, and of individual annexes, \nshould be kept to a sensible min.  \n \nb. Pro.  Pro at div level is DAPM.  \n \nc. PCS.  PC tp is part of the GS Regt RLC and needs to know locs and task org.  \n \n29. Distr of Annexes .  Annexes may have a different distr to the main CSSO.  All such \nannexes would therefore need to fol the full form.  \n \n \n SERIAL 3-06-06 \n3–06–06 - 1 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 TASK ORGANISATION (TASKORG)   \n6.1. Conventions.  The grouping of forces for specific operations or phases within operations is \ndescribed by a Task Organisation (TaskOrg).  \na. The aim of graphical task organisation should be to produce a clear, logical and \nunambiguous picture of formations , units  or task specific groupings and their respective states \nof co mmand for an operation or phase of an operation.  For clarity a separate full or \nabbreviated task organisation may be nec essary for each phase of an operation,  when \nregrouping takes place.  \nb. The system is best equated to double entry book -keeping, where entries are made both \nin the credit and debit sect ions, in that changes to units  are shown in the attachments  and \ndetachments  columns.  \nc. Regardless of the template you use, the following  information  should be displayed in the \ncolumns:  \n(1) Level of command in the title box at the head of each column.  \n(2) Manoeuvre units operate under a level of com mand  and state of command  of \neach individual unit in main sect of column.  \n(3) Units are detached  from a level of comd in ( -) sect of column.  \n6.2. Display.  Task Org is displayed in columns.  Each column is headed by the symbol of a \nformation or unit immediately subordinate to the originator (ie a division  operation order  is in brigade \ncolumns, a brigade operation order  is in regimental , battalion or battle group columns).  Troo ps \nallocated special tasks ( reserves , rear area security , guard , screen, etc) are usually listed under a \ncolumn headed ‘Special Tasks’.   However,  where such a task is to be carried out by one of the \nmanoeuvre units  or formatio ns, it may remain in the main body of the task org rather than move to \n‘Special Tasks’ column. Troops  organic to originator ( division al troops , brigade troops ) are listed \nunder separate column, ‘Div Tps’ etc, but only changes to such troops  need be shown.  Blank \ncolumns may be left for the regrouping of formations  or units.  \n6.3. States of Comd.  Op comd takes precedence over admin comd.  Within columns all unit \nsymbols are gp in the order:  \nFULL COMD   ADCON \nOPCOM    ADCON less.... \nOPCON    LOGCON  \nTACOM     \nTACON    \n  \nAlthough operation order  task orgs usually only need to show operational  states of comd, both \noperational  and admin states should be shown if the admin state changes or if there is a need to \nclarify the sit, i.e.:  \n(1) OPCOM and ADCON   \n(2) OPCOM and ADCON less...  \n(3) OPCON and ADCON less...  \n(4) OPCON and ADCON  \n(5) TACON and ADCON  \n SERIAL 3-06-06 \n3–06–06 - 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.4. Precedence.  Precedence for listing in each state of comd is:  \nArmour in order of unit precedence within each arm but note that in a bde task org,  \nInfantry  The unit providing the B attle Group HQ is shown as the first entry in the main sect  of \nthe column, regardless of unit precedence.  \nCbt Sp  Artillery, Engineer, Communication, Helicopters  In order of size and, if of same size, \nin numerical order  \nCSS Logistics, Health Service  Support , Equipment Support, MP In order of size and, if of \nsame size, in numerical order  \n6.5. Field Indicator .  When the level of command  in a column is a b attle group, there are \ndifferent conventions on how to display the sub- units organic to that parent unit which are to remain \ngrouped with it.   \na. Option 1 . It is sufficient to repeat the regimen t or b attalio n symbol with the addition of a \nminus sign to reflect any det achments  to another com mand .  Only the size indicator field on \nthe column title symbol will be capped to rep resent  an all arms group ( battle group) . \nb. Option 2 .  List every sub -unit in the column as shown in the example below.  \n6.6. Detachments . \na. Where a symbol shows ( -), the detachment  is to be shown in the ( -) sect at the bottom of \neach column.  This rule applies to troops  organic to originator and to non- organic  troops who \nare then split up within the formation  they have come to support .  Non -organic troops  which \narrive already depleted to support  the formation should have their previous detachment  shown \nagainst the symbol in the main column.  \nb. When a formation  (eg brigade) is detached  from its parent formation  (eg Division ) only \nthe brigade HQ and its own Armour and Infantry  units are detached.  If artillery , engineer  or \nother units are also to be det this must be shown under ‘Div Tps’, unless they are themselves \norganic rather than affiliated.  \nc. Battlegrouping .1  The combat element of a combined arms group is described in terms \nof the number of subunits of each type it has under command, as follows and in the order of:  \n \n(1) Armour  \n(2) Infantry  \n(3) A combined arms grouping of : \n(a) 2 x Tank Companies  and 1 x Infantry Company is shown as (2, 1)  \n(b) 1 x Tank Company  and 3 x Infantry Companies  is shown as (1, 3)  \n   \n6.7. Special Tasks.  If a special task ( brigade Guard, divisional  reserve ) is based on 2 or more \nsubunits  of equal size, the command  must be nominated by name or appt and shown in the column.  \n6.8. Half Bars .  Half bars are normally only used in relation to the ‘Special Tasks’ columns to \nidentify separate states of command when there is more than one group or task  shown in a single \ncolumn.  They follow the rules of paragraph headings in non- op SD: once started they should \ncontinue to be used down to the next special task or level of command  which is then to be identified  \nwith a full bar.  \n \n1 Source is Planning and Execution Handbook Ch 8 dated Mar 23.  \n SERIAL 3-06-06 \n3–06–06 - 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.9.

The first output of the Joint Air Estimate is the Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP), also \nknown as the SUPLAN AIR in NATO doctrine. The JAOP is the air commander’s blueprint \nfor integrating and coordinating air activities. It should include;  plans to transition from initial \nto sustainment forces as appropriate; plans for conflict termination and the subsequent \nredeployment of forces; and procedures to be used to capture lessons.  \n1.2. The JAOP provides:  \na. Objectives and tasks by priority, describing in which order they should be \nactioned, the desired effects and the weight of effort required.  \nb. The measures or indicators of success that are to be used to determine whether \njoint air operations are meeting assigned objectives; accounting for current and \npotential enemy offensive and defensive COA.  \nc.

Analysis, planning and decision making in the Maritime environment follow similar \nprocesses, procedures and formats to those done at the higher tactical level in other \nenvironments.  The Maritime Component Commander (MCC) and his HQ staff will \nparticipate in the Joint Task Force Commander’s planning; contributing their  specialist \nmaritime knowledge to the process.  The MCC will also conduct his own estimate and planning process ; the output of which will be plans and orders for his  component (Task \nForce).  This will contain the missions and tasks for any subordinate task groups, task units \nand task elements.  \nMARITIME OPERATIONAL STAFF WORK (OSW)  \n1.2. The MCC uses the same common  ‘Plans and Orders ’ framework of OSW  as the \nother components.  Normally the MCC  will issue an OPLAN or OPORD in St ep 7; altered by \nthe issue of FRAGOs as required.  With modern communications these can be transmitted \nelectronically from shore to ship or ship to ship.  \nOPGEN - SIGNAL MESSAGE ORDERS  \n1.3. If time is short or communications degraded, orders may be issued using a formatted \nsignal message called an OPGEN .   \nSERIAL 3-09-01 \n3–09–01 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT  (IRM) \n1.1. General . The staff’s role is to support the commander and the subordinate units and  \norganisations. The basis of the staff ’s role lies in generating, moving and packaging \ninformation such that it can be exploited by commanders and subordinates to make the right \ndecision.  \n1.2. Definitions : \na. Information Requirements Management  (IRM) .  The management of \ninformation regarding an adversary or potentially hostile actors and other relevant \naspects of the operational environment that needs to be collected and processed to \nmeet the intelligence requirements of a commander.  \nb. Information Management (IM) . IM is a set of integrated management processes \nand services that enable and support the capability for collectors, producers and users \nto store,  locate, retrieve and transform information, allowing it to become the right \ninformation in the right form and of adequate quality to satisfy the demands of the \ncommander or  organisation.  \nc. Information Exploitation (IX) . The sharing and use of information to support \nsituation awareness, planning and decision making and the coordination of desired \neffects.  \n1.3. Information Management : The Basis of Decision Making. The chance of making \nthe right decision is increased with the fidelity and accuracy of the information on which that \ndecision will be based.  Information must therefore be accurate, unambiguous, concise, \nclear, consistent and timely.  The origins (provenance) and status (such as historic or \ncurrent, draft or final) of the information must be known and it should be in a form which is \naccessible and usable and stored and passed in a way that ensures it is protected. This \nrequirement forms the basis of Information Management (IM).  \n1.4. Storing Information. Information must be stored in the right place, correctly labelled, \nso that found and used again. Staff need to be familiar with file structures, drives and \ndatabases, the methods of labelling information and be able to work collaboratively.  \n1.5. File Naming Convention \na. Format  \n(1) Document and Record names must consist of three elements, separated \nby hyphens ( -):• Date -Title-Protective Marking \n(2) Only the following characters are normally allowed:  • A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \nhyphen, round brackets, space, underscore.  \n(3) Where an application is unable to handle round brackets or spaces \nsatisfactorily, use underscores instead.  \n(4) The three elements, consisting of mandatory (listed in BOLD \nUPPERCASE) and optional parts are described in the  paragraphs below.  \nb. Date  - This must show when the version of the document was created or \namended. It consists of:  \n(1) DATE  (in the format YYYYMMDD);  \n(2) An UNDERSCORE -  this is only required if a time is included;  \n(3) TIME  (in the format HHMMZ, where Z is the appropriate Time Zone).  \nc. Title - consists of the following parts, separated by single spaces:  \n(1) DESCRIPTION - this should be meaningful but concise;  \nSERIAL 3-09-01 \n3–09–01 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 (2) DOCUMENT STATUS -  this should be included where the status of the \ndocument is important or  requires clarification. Examples include `Draft’, `Under \nReview’, `Final’ and `Published’;  \n(3) VERSION (in the format “vx_y” where x represents the major version \nidentifier, and y the minor one -  see Version Numbering, over) if required;  \n(4) ORIGINATING UNIT or ROLE, if required;  \n(5) FILE REFERENCE, if required.  \nd. VERSION NUMBERING . • In order to track the status of a document the \nfollowing system should be used:  \n(1) The major identifier is the number of the version promulgated (or, for \ndrafts, to be promulgated);  \n(2) The minor identifier is numeric for live versions and alphabetic for draft \nversions. (To avoid confusion with 0, O is eliminated from the alphabetic \nsequence. Z is followed by AA, AZ by BA, etc.)  \n(3) Examples  \n(a) The first draft of a document is v1_A, and subsequent drafts are \nv1_B, v1_C.  \n(b) The first live document is always v1_0.  \n(c) Minor amendments for live are v1_1, v1_2, v1_3.  \n(d) Drafts of the next major release are v2_A, v2_B, v2_C.  \n1.6. Information Exploitation (IX) . Information exploitation is the staff’s usage and reuse \nof information that  has been gathered from across the information environment in order to \nprovide situational  awareness or inform decisions.  \na. Collaborative Working . Collaborative working requires an iterative exchange of  \ninformation which progressively adds value and deepens understanding. Staff work in \na virtual, not necessarily physical, location to produce a common output. Collaborative \nworking increases tempo and efficiency.  \nb. Information Superiority . Information Superiority is the capability to collect,  \nprocess, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while exploiting or  \ndenying an adversary’s ability to do similarly. Two key elements which will assist in  \nachieving information superiority are:  \n(1) Search. Efficient labelling, logical storage and forensic weeding of out of \ndate information, coupled with good search tools will improve staff ability to \nretrieve the  right information. Further guidance on search is contained in IM \nProtocol 024.  \n(2) Fusing and Presenting Information. Staff should consider how \ninformation should be fused, packaged and presented depending on the length \nof preparation time and the prior knowledge of the person to whom it will be \npassed.  \nSERIAL 3-10-01 \n3–10–01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 JOINT BATTLESPACE MANAGEMENT (B M) (AJP-3 Annex C) \n1.1. Battle space Management  (BM) :  Defined as: “ Battlespace management is the use \nof all necessary adaptive means and measures that enable the planned and dynamic \ncoordination, synchronization and prioritization of activities across all dimensions of an \nassigned area of operations within the battlespace,”  (AJP-3) .\n1.\n2. Battlespace : Defined as:  “The environment, factors and conditions that must be \nunderstood to apply combat power, protect a force or complete a mission successfully. ” \n(AJP-3)\nNote: It includes the land, maritime, air  and space domains ; the enemy and friendly forces \npresent therein; facilities; terrestrial and space weather; health hazards; terrain; the \nelectromagnetic spectrum; and the information environment in the joint operations area and \nother areas of interest.   \n1.3.  Purpose. Battlespace management applies at all levels of operations and enables \noperational level activities in cooperation with relevant non -NATO actors. Effective \nbattlespace management will ensure the appropriate allocation of three -dimensional space \nand the electromagnetic spectrum, over time, to various competing users, to maximize coordinated and synchronous operational effectiveness, while avoiding confusion leading to \na risk to the mission and/or the force.  \n1.4. Multi -domain Battlespace Management .  BM must be considered in the physical \nand non- physical battlespace across all domains and time.  Particular issues arise at seams \nand boundaries where the activities of different assets and capabilities within the joint force \ninteract with or impact others.  \n1.5. What is Battlespace Management ? Battle space management (BM) provides a \nnumber of tools and processes to help co -ordinate, synchronise and prioritise the military \nactivity throughout the Joint Task Force.  All the components involved in an operation will \nhave their initial battle- space conditions set by the JTFHQ. This will be promulgated in either \na discrete Joint Battlespace Management Instruction Document or a BM Annex to an OPLAN or OPORD.  BM is controlled by J3/5.  The purpose of BM is to maximise freedom of \naction / manoeuvre across domain boundaries  and to minimise constraints for all battle-\nspace users, while managing and reducing the risk of blue- on-blue.   \nFigure 1. 1Illustra tes the requirement for BM increases as component activity becomes more integrated  Enabling Battle -space Management\nLevel of Required InteractionIndependent\nComponent\n ActivitySynchronised\nComponent\n ActivityIntegrated\nComponent\n Activity\nSERIAL 3-10-01 \n3–10–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 1.\n6. BM Components: Joint Battle- space Management is divided into: \na. Physical Battlespace.\nb. Non-physical Battlespace.\n1.7. Physical Battlespace.  \na. Maritime BM :  Ma ritime BM consists of 4 aspects:\n(1) Water-space management,\n(2) Naval cooperation and guidance for shipping,\n(3) Amphibious operations,\n(4) Maritime  / land interface.\nb. Land BM :  Unlike Air and Maritime, Land BM is likely to require a combination of\nintegrated measures.  Each component commander will need battle- space to conduct\noperations. Land BM consists of 4 requirements:\n(1) Manoeuvre.\n(2) Air Defence (AD).\n(3) Airspace Control (ASC).\n(4) Fire Support Coord Measures (FSCM)\nc. Air BM  is known as Airspace Management (ASM) :  Routine ASM is delegat ed\nt\no a single Airspace Control Authority (ACA). The Air Component Commander (ACC)\nwill usually be the ACA for all airspace in the JOA / ASC -area.  All components have\nthe means for routine input to ASC through Airspace Control Means (ACM)\npromulgated through the Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Coordination Order (ACO)\nand Special Instructions (SPINS).\nd. Space BM . Space represents a domain in its own right, but also serves as  an\nenabl\ner for the more traditional operating environments of maritime, land and air.\nSpace- based capabilities enable strategic communications, command and control\n(C2), situational awareness (SA), and precision strike capabilities.\n1.8. Non-p hysical Battlespace: \na. Electromagnetic Spectrum M anagement  (ESM):  This is  the planning,\ncoordination and management of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) thr ough\noper\national, engineering and administrative procedures. It enables military electronic\nsystems to perform their functions within intended environments without causing orsuffering harmful interference.\nb. Information. The information environment includes the information itself, t he\ni\nndividuals and organizations, in addition to the cognitive, virtual and physical space i n\nw\nhich this occurs. The importance of worldwide distributed information, the speed at\nwhich information is communicated, the role of media and the reliability of informati on\ns\nystems have created a situation in which no decision or action can be taken without\nconsidering its potential impact on the  information environment.\nc. Cyberspace. Cyberspace is the virtual, non- physical domain formed by all\ninformation technology systems interconnected on a global scale. Cyberspace attacks\nare becoming more intense, complex and reflective of an increased level  of\nsophistication. The risks and opportunities offered through offensive and defensiv e\nc\nyberspace activities make it an important element of the commander’s  battlespace\nmanagement plan.\nSERIAL 3-10-01 \n3–10–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 d.

Land  Battlespace Management Controls, \nincorporating the 4 aspects of Land BM (Manoeuvre, Air Defence (AD), Fire Support control \nmeasures (FSCM) and Air Space Control (ASC)), are split into 2 areas;  \na. Terrain Management (TM)  \nb. Fire Support Coordination Measures (FSCM).  \n2.2. Terrain Management  (TM). Control Measures such as boundaries, defined routes, \nterrain allocation and other restrictions, reduce the risk of blue- on-blue whilst enabling \nmanoeuvre and maximising terrain use.  \na. Scope. TM encompasses the establishment of priority for use of the ground and \nallocation of land, the delegation of landspace control, tracking, activating and promulgating changes, monitoring of force levels within given landspace, EMCON, and \nestablishing robust coordinating instructions.  \nb. Priorities . Priority of use will be dictated by the nature of the operation but \ninclude:  \n(1) Int Collection Assets    & Comms assets  \n(2) Div Reserve     & GS engineering assets  \n(3) Formation HQ     & Utility Avn AH and SH \n(4) Ground Manoeuvre assets   & Second- line CSS  \n(5) OSG assets (incl ARAs / AMAs)   & Unoccupied AMAs  \nc. Bids for Landspace . The G3 Ops terrain / ops trace is the authority for unit \nlocations and control measures. Units requiring landspace in an area controlled by \nanother formation or component must bid through G3 Ops.  \n2.3. Fire Support Coordination Measures  (FSCM ). FSCM provide the means to \nseparate, synchronise or integrate land, air and maritime Fires to support the manoeuvre \ncommander’s intent and operations plan, and to  allow the maximum exploitation of available \nfire support assets while ensuring the safety  of own troops against blue- on-blue. By their \nnature, FSCM tend to be short term and  immediate. It is critical that FSCM are deactivated \nas soon as practical after a fire mission.  FSCM can either be permissive or restr ictive in \nnature. All boundaries are by default  Restricted Fire Lines (RFL):  \na. Permissive Measures . These facilitate the attack of targets. No further \ncoordination is required within permissive areas. These include:  \n(1) Fire Support Coordination Line (FSCL).  \n(2) Free Fire Area (FFA).  \n(3) Coordinated Fire Line (CFL).  \nb. Restrictive Measures. These provide safeguards to Friendly Forces or objects. \nTheir  establishment requires certain coordination to occur prior to the engagement of \nthose targets.

General Points .  The airspace within a JOA is a joint environment and therefore it is \nmanaged on a joint basis.  Responsibility for managing the airspace - the Airspace Control \nAuthority (ACA) - is usually given to the component best able to discharge that responsibility; \ninvariably the JFACC.  All users of the airspace must be aware of the problems and the \nmeasures taken to facilitate ops, identify users and minimize risks.  These measures are \ncollectively known as Airspace Control (ASC) and invariably represent a compromise \nbetween conflicting demands.  ASC is a service to airspace users.  Many land assets, such \nas BH, MLRS, arty, mors, UAVs and GBAD exploit the 3rd dimension.  All require airspace \nand need the minimum of restrictions to achieve tempo.  The ACA constructs an Air Control \nPlan (ACP) to support the Joint Campaign Plan and endeavours to take account of CCs’ requirements to meet the scheme of manoeuvre.  The ACP is fully compatible with the Joint Air Defence Plan (ADP).  \n3.2. Control .  In the LCC HQ the AD cell will normally be responsible for Airspace Control \n(ASC) matters in conjunction with the LC representative in the Joint Airspace Coordination \nCentre (JACC).  AD coordinates unit ASC, requests Airspace Control Measures (ACM) and \ndisseminates Airspace Control Orders (ACO).  Subject to the JTFC priorities the LCC will usually have authority over air operations within the LCC AO short of the FSCL once a \nsuitable degree of control of the air has been achieved.  ASC is exercised through either \npositive or procedural control and as the operations situation may require a combination of \nboth methods they must be complementary. \n3.3. Positive Control .  Relies on positive identification, tracking and direction of a \nplatform within designated airspace, conducted with electronic means by an agency with the \nappropriate authority and responsibility.  Consequently this type of control is asset intensive \nneeding equipment such as radar/surv sensors, ID procedures, 2- way comms/data links and \nother C4I elements to track, identify and direct.   \n3.4. Procedural Control .  Relies on a combination of previously agreed and promulgated \norders and procedures.  Procedural control may segment the airspace by volume and time \nand/or the use of weapon control status.  This form of control relies on ACMs and WCOs \nissued via the ACO  and Special Instructions (SPINS) to identify airspace access within \nagreed parameters.   \n3.5. Time Deconfliction. \nFigure 3. 1 Illustrating time deconfliction ASM  \nSERIAL 3-10-03 \n3–10–03 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 Time deconfliction requires detailed coordination and may be required when aircrew fly near \nindirect fire trajectories or ordnance effects. The timing of surface fires must be coordinated \nwith aircraft routing.  \n3.6. Spatial Deconfliction . The separation of activities in space offers far more \nopportunities to integrate assets. Spatial deconfliction can be used to attack multiple \nadjacent targets simultaneously or, with detailed planning, the engagement of the same \ntarget. In order to achieve this, the aerial platforms’ flight paths or battle positions must be \ndeconflicted with weapon trajectories and effects. This method requires that the air vehicle is \noffset from weapon trajectories, and operating at safe distance from the point of impact . \n \nFigure 3. 2 Illustrating spatial deconfliction ASM  \n3.7.

Whichever method of ASC is in force it will have to be coordinated by the \nACA with all airspace users and promulgated in the ACO.  \n\nSERIAL 3-10-04 \n3–10–04 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 COMBAT ID  \n4.1. What is Combat ID (CID)?  CID is the process of attaining an accurate and timely \ncharacterisation of detected objects in the battlespace to support an engagement decision or \nof “combining Situational Awareness (SA), Target Identification (Tgt ID) and specific Tactics, \nTechniques and Procedures (TTPs) to increase operational effectiveness of weapon \nsystems and reduce the incidence of casualties caused by friendly fire.  \n4.2. Who is responsible for Combat ID?  The JTFHQ and all Component HQs are \nresponsible for ensuring C ombat ID is established to an appropriate degree to  minimise the \nrisk of fratricide in cross -component engagement.  \n4.3. How are errors made?  The following two areas impact on an individual’s ability to \nunderstand and judge the situation and establish CID  \na. Human Factors (HF): (eg stress, fatigue, fear, mental capacity, personality, \nexperience, ex pectation and briefing, culture, language and survival)  \nb. Operational  Characteristics : (eg sensitivity, complexity, environmental impact \nand change in ORBATs and groupings)  \n4.4. What methods can you use to establish Combat ID ?  A mixture of  these three \narea help establish strong combat ID:  \na. Situational Awareness (SA).   Situational awareness affects the expectation of \nan object’s presence in space and time being friendly or enemy. Familiarity with both \nthe plan and the current situation are essential and may be aided by command \nsystems and reports and returns .  \nb. Target Identification (Tgt ID) . Tgt ID involves recognition of the tgt or a \ncomponent part (eg an indicator beacon). Positive ID (PID) is established when the observer identifies an object. He may PID it as enemy, friendly or neutral. Negative ID \nis established when the observer is certain the object is not of a certain type but \ncannot confirm which type it is.  \nc. Tactics Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) .  TTPs affect the speed at which \nCID can be established and includes aspects of positive control, eg ensuring all FEs \nreport their current loc or when they are clear of an area prior to targeting, and \nprocedural control through BM measures eg bdrys/RFLs and OOB boxes.  \n4.5. Combat ID Com mand Responsibilities . \na. Pre-Action.

Scope.  This serial deals with the topic of command and control and command states \nand supported / supporting relationships . (Source AJP- 01, AJP-3 & AFM Command ). \n1.2. What is Command  & Control ?  Command and control is an institutional and \ncompound term.  It can be a process, a capability, a system or a structure.  It can also be \ntreated as a single whole, 'command and control', with a different meaning to the separate \nwords of 'command' and 'control'. The words ‘command’ and ‘control’ are explained below \nand are exercised through mission command.  (AJP -01) \n1.3. Command Definition : “The authority vested in an individual of the armed forces for \nthe direction , coordination, and control  of military forces. (AAP -06 (2014)).  \n•Direction:  This is defining the objectives to achieve, the actions to take, and theresources and procedures required to achieve those objectives.\n•Coordination.  This is harmonizing and guiding assigned forces to achieve theobjectives.\n•Control :  Control is defined as: ‘the authority exercised by a commander over part of\nthe activities of subordinate organizations, or other organizations not normally undertheir command, encompassing the responsibility for implementing orders or\ndirectives.’ (AAP- 06 (2014)) Control  is to manage and direct forces and functions\nconsistent with a commander’s  command authority\n.\n1.\n4. Principles of J oint & Multinational Command . The following are the principles of \njoint and multinational command.  (AJP- 01 Para 5.4)  \nPrinciple  Note s (abridged)  \nUnity of \nCommand  Unity of command means that all forces operate under one  \ndesignated commander. It requires a single commander  with the \nrequisite authority to direct all forces in pursuit of  the agreed \nobjectives or end state. At the military strategic, operational and \ntactical levels of command, a fundamental  element of C2 is unity \nof command, which provides the  necessary cohesion for the \nplanning and execution of  operations.  \nContinuity of \nCommand  Command should be continuous throughout an operation. During \nan operation, further enhancement of unity of command is desirable through continuity of command. In principle, ‘the \ncommander who plans should execute’; however, circumstances \nmay not permit thi s. \n \nChain of \nCommand  The C2 structure is a hierarchical system and should be defined \nand understood, with all its command responsibilities, by all levels \nof command. A clear chain of  command strengthens integration \nbetween components.  \nIntegration of \nCommand  The command structure should ensure that capabilities are \ndirected decisively  to achieve the operational objectives in the \nmost effective way. Component commands are normally \nenvironmental or functional, but the  specific task organization will \nreflect the higher commander’s  specific operations requirements. \nAn efficient and  comprehensive liaison structure, linking the joint \ntask force  headquarters, all force elements and other \norganisations  is an essential element of the C2 structure.  \nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 2\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.5. Elements of Command.  Command also embraces authority, responsibility and \naccountability. Command has a legal status. It is also vested in a commander by their \nsuperior.   \n•Authority enables an individual to influence events and order subordinates to\nimplement decisions.\n•Responsibility . While commanders can devolve specific authority, they retain overall\nresponsibility for their command – responsibility is thus fundamental to command.\n•Accountability  involves a liability and obligation to answer for properly usi ng\ndel\negated responsibility, authority and resources; it includes the duty to act.  Thus,  a\nc\nommander who delegates responsibility should grant sufficient authority t o\ns\nubordinates to enable them to carry out their task.  Subordinates remai n\nac\ncountable to their superior for executing assigned tasks.\n1.6. Exercising Command:  Military command at all levels is the art of decision making, \nmotivating and directing forces into action to accomplish missions.  It is founded on \nunderstanding and constant assessment of the operating environment and its various actors \nand audiences, people, resources, risk and desired outcomes.  A commander determines \ncourses of action to be taken, leads the force and controls the execution of the mission.   \n1.7. Functions of Command.  The three functions of \ncommand, which are inter -dependent, are decision-\nmaking, leadership and control.  See Fig 1.1.  \n1.8. Command Support .  The following elements are \nrequired to support a commander:  \n•A Staff.\n•Provision of an HQ.\n•Communications and Information Systems.\n•Staff processes and procedures.\n1.9. Commander  & Staff :  A command system \ncomprises not only the commander, but also the staff \nwho, depending on the level of command, contribute to \nthe effect of all three functions, with particular emphasis on control.  Deficiencies in any of the constituents of \ncommand have a detrimental effect on a force’s fighting \npower as a whole.  Commanders should always be prepared to make use of the ideas and \nobjections of others.  Good ideas are not the sole preserve of senior ranks.  \n1.10.  Mission Command .  The philosophy of mission command is covered in \nSOHB Serial 1-02-01. \n1.11.  Commanding  in a Multinational Environment : \n•Operating multinationally, either as part of a formal alliance or an ad hoc coaliti on\ni\nntroduces many challenges for both the multinational JFC and contributing nations’\nnational contingent commanders.\n•A multinational force commander requires political acumen, patience and tact.\n•A force commander should appreciate the linguistic and cultural challenges of\nmultinational operations, recognising that it is their responsibility to communicate wit h\nal\nl subordinates including those for whom English is not the first language.\n•JFCs must understand the national political sensitivities of each of their contingents;\nany anticipated points of difference should be resolved early .\n1.12.  Commanders  and the Media .  The media has become so important in maintaining \npublic and political support that a commander cannot disconnect themselves from it, nor \nshould they allow it to be the sole focus of their efforts.

The \ndescriptions which follow enable a full understanding of the revised C2 terminology.  \n•Command arrangements must always be qualified by the DTG at which they begin.\n•They should also specify the DTG at which they are likely to end and  must\nac\ncommodate the situation prior to and after transfer of authority (TOA).\n•Note that when working in a multinational environment, the authority grant ed\nt\nhrough command states must be clarified with the issuing commander.\n•While commanders may delegate their authority, they always retain responsibility.\n1.14.  Full Command (FULLCOM) . “The military authority and responsibility of a \ncommander to issue orders to subordinates .”  \n•Notes: Full command covers every aspect of military operations and administration\nand exists only within national services.\n•The term “command” as used internationally, implies a lesser  degree of authority\nthan when it is used in a purely national sense.\n•NATO and coalition commanders do not have full command  over their forces\nassigned to them since nations will delegate only  operational command or\noperational control.\n1.15.  Operational Command (OPCOM).  “The authority granted to a commander to \nassign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units, to reassign forces, and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical command and/ or tactical control, as the commander deems necessary .”  \n•Note: Operational command does not include responsibility for  administration.\nSer Authority  FULLCOM OPCO M OPCON  TACO M TACON  \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) \n1 Task Organise  the assigned \nelement  X X \n2 Assign  mission s to the assigned \nelement (1) X X X \n(Limited)  \n3 Assign tasks to the assigned element \nfor the purpose of which it has been \nassigned  X X X X \n(Limited)  \n4 May further delegate command authority\n OPCOM  \nOPCON  \nTACOM  \nTACON  OPCOM  \nOPCON  \nTACOM  \nTACON  OPCON  \nTACOM  \nTACON  TACOM  \nTACON  TACON  \n5 Coordinate movement, local defence  \nand force protection.

AAP- 6 does not define a task. Within the context of command states, tasks are \nundertaken within (and are subordinate to) the subordinate force element’s mission. Tasks are \nusually limited by function, time or location.   \n1.16.  Figure 1.2. Abridged Arabic explanation of command & control states & relationships \nbelow Full Command. \n1.\n17. Operational Control (OPCON) .  “The authority delegated to a commander to direct \nassigned forces to accomplish specific missions or tasks that are usually limited by function, \ntime, or location; to deploy units concerned, and to retain or assign tactical command or \ncontrol of those units. ”  \n•Notes: Operational control does not include authority to assign separate\nemployment of components of the units concerned and does not incl ude\nadm\ninistrative or logistic control.\n•For forces allocated under OPCON the gaining commander may not break up t he\nor\nganizational integrity of the force for separate employment.  Under OPCON forces\nassigned may only be employed within certain constraints such as function, time orlocation imposed by the higher authority.\n•For example, the forces may only  be assigned for a single phase of a particular\noperation.  This may be done for national purposes in the case of a multinational\ncontext, where it is in a participating nation’s interest to constrain in some fashi\non\nt\nhe employment of the contributed force.\n•Under OPCON the gaining commander may assign a mission to the assig ned\nel\nement that is distinct from, but related to, the gaining commander’s overall\nmission.\n1.18.  Tactical Command (TACOM) .  “The authority delegated to a commander to assign \ntasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by \nhigher authority, and to retain or delegate tactical control of units.”  \n•Note : Under TACOM the gaining commander may only allocate to the assi gned\nf\norce a specific task consistent for the accomplishment of the mission and purpose\nassigned by the higher commander, that is, within the parameters of the current\nmission given by the higher authority.\n•TACOM is used where the superior commander recognizes the need for additionalresources for a task but requires the resources intact for a later role.\n•Under TACOM the assigned force is allocated for specific tasks and is allocat\ned\nnor\nmally for a limited period of time.  This prevents the gaining commander from\nemploying the assigned force in a role or manner not intended by the higher\n\nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 5\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 commander.  When the task is complete, or the specific timeframe expires, the \nTACOM relationship with the gaining force ends.   \n•TACOM is usually applied to specific situations and to elements that have uni que\nc\napabilities.\n1.19.  Tactical Control (TACON) .  “The detailed and, usually, local direction and control of \nmovements or manoeuvres necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned.”   \n•Note s: TACON is generally used to indicate those units that will be located withi n\nanot\nher unit or formation’s assigned geographical boundaries, and by so assigning,\nthe gaining unit becomes responsible for coordination aspects within the shar ed\nar\nea of operations.\n•The gaining commander has authority to coordinate local defence, force protecti on\nand t\nerrain allocation.\n1.20.  Control and Coordination Terms. The following terms may be ascribed \nindependently to  operational and tactical C2 states to delegate elements of authority.  \n1.21.  Administrative Control (ADCON) .  “Direction or exercise of authority over \nsubordinate or other organizations in respect to administrative matters such as personnel \nmanagement, supply, services, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizat ions. ”  \n•Note: No NATO or coalition commander has administrative control over the forces\nassigned to them since, in assigning forces to NATO, nations will delegate only\noperational command or control.\n1.22.  Logistic control (LOGCON) .  “The authority granted to a (NATO) Commander over \nassigned logistics units and organisations in the joint operations area, including national \nsupport elements, that empowers them to synchronize, prioritize, and integrate their logistics functions and activities to accomplish the joint theatre mission.” \n•Note: It does not confer authority over nationally owned resources held by\n a\nnat\nional support element, except as agreed in the transfer of authority or in\naccordance with (NATO) principles and policies for logistics\n1.23.  Coordinating Authority (CA) or DIRLAUTH (Direct Liaison Authority)  \nCoordinating authority is the authority granted to a commander or other individual with assigned responsibility to coordinate specific functions or activities of two or more forces, \ncommands, services or organizations.  The commander or individual has the authority to \nrequire consultation between the organizations involved or their representatives but does not \nhave the authority to compel agreement.  In case of disagreement between the \norganizations involved, the commander or  individual should attempt to obtain essential \nagreement by discussion.  In the event they are unable to obtain essential agreement they \nshall refer the matter to the appropriate authority . \n1.24.  DIRLAUTH. Although AJP- 3(C) uses DIRLAUTH synonymously with CA, UK usage \nmeans  ‘direct liaison authorized’.  Clearly there is potential for confusion, especially when \noperating with MN partners. AAP -6 does not recognise the term DIRLAUTH . \n1.25.  Understanding C2 Authority . The following examples explain the status of \nassigned forces:  \nCan I break up force elements and \ndirect the separate employment of \ntheir component parts?  Only OPCOM authorises the commander to split force \nelements and use component parts separately.  \nCan I use force elements for any \npurpose (give them missions)? Only OPCOM authorises the commander to assign \nmissions to force elements. OPCON authorises the \ncommander to assign missions or tasks for the \nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 6\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher \nauthority.  \nCan I give force elements tasks in \naccordance with their mission?  TACOM allows tasks to be issued to subordinates within \nthe mission given to them by their OPCOM or OPCON \ncommander.  \nCan I delegate control to other \nforce elements (is the relationship \nOP or TAC)?  Only OP command states (OPCOM and OPCON) can \nauthorise delegation of control to another force element.  \nS\nupported/Supporting Relationships  \n1.26.  Overview .  The execution of military operations will often be guided by the \nsupported/supporting relationship when one command, force or unit should aid, protect, \ncomplement or sustain another. This key relationship provides the establishing authority with \nan effective means of weighting the phases and sub- phases of operations with a subordinate \ncommander typically receiving support from, and providing support to, other commanders. \nThe supported/supporting relationship allows the strengths and capabilities of the \nheadquarters and forces of the military command structure to complement each other. \nWithin a force, components or elements can support or be supported for the conduct of a particular activity to create effects.  Subordinate commanders may be supported and act as \nsupporting commanders concurrently. The supported/supporting relationship must work both \nways. The supported commander must be able to participate and comment on developing \nsupport plans of supporting commanders. A complete understanding of the supported \ncommander’s mission, assigned objectives, force capabilities and intent is critical to enable \nthe supporting commander to meet their responsibilities flexibly.  \n1.27.  General Guidance .  A supported commander may be designated for the entire \noperation, a specific phase of an operation, a particular function, or a combination of phases, stages, events and functions  (ie Line of operation, Decisive Condition (DC) or Ope rational \nEffect (OE) or Joint Action ).  \n1.28.  Authority of s upported commander .  Unless limited by Joint Coordination Order or \nFRAGO , the supported commander has the authority for the general direction of the \ndesignated task.  General direction includes the designation and prioritization of targets or \nobjectives, timing and duration of the supporting action, and other instructions necessary for \ncoordination and efficiency.  The JTFHQ  is responsible for ensuring that the supported and \nsupporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander is granted.  \n1.29.  Supported commander .  A supported component commander ‘has primary \nresponsibility for all aspects of a task assigned by higher authority’ and details the support \nrequired from the supporting component commanders, through the JTFC.  \n1.30.  The supporting commander .  A supporting component commander advises the \nsupported component commander on the optimum employment of his assets then delivers \ncapability or support to him, prioritising tasks as required. The supporting component commander may develop a discrete supporting plan but will invariably direct the specific \nactivities of his component elements .  When the supporting commander cannot fulfil the \nneeds of the supported commander, the JTFHQ  will be notified by either the supported or \nsupporting commander. The JTFHQ  is responsible for determining a solution and assigning \npriorities . \nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 7\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.31.

Optimum coordination between t he Joint Task Force and all \ncomponent commands is only achieved when each component command knows the \nintentions and capabilities of the other components and also understands the impact of its \nactions on them.  This is enabled through establishing liaison and communications networks. \n2.2. Component Representation in the Joint Task Force Headquarters.  Each \ncomponent command will have a senior representative, vested with authority to make \nrecommendations and facilitate decision- making at the main joint operations planning group \nand joint coordination board.  At the working level, component commands may also need \nspecialists to represent their interests at the various sub- boards, meetings and other \ncoordination mechanisms that make up the staff processes.  When a component command \nis collocate d with JTF HQ, this remit may be reduced.  However, the joint forces maritime \ncommand, the ACC and special operations component command will almost certainly require empowered high quality liaison officers permanently placed within the JTF HQ.  \n2.3. Liaison Officer s’ Role and Tasks.   \n2.\n4. Liaison between Components. In addition to the liaison link up to the JTF HQ, \nliaison between component commands is vital.  Inter-component coordination and liaison \nstaff teams act as the principal method of coordination in ensuring critical information is \nassessed and disseminated throughout the chain of command.  They also have an essential \nrole to play in their host component’s plans and execution, particularly regarding the synchronization of overall component activity.  While liaison teams should be integrated into \ntheir host HQ structure, they are nonetheless responsible to their parent component command.  The requirement for liaison officers is likely to require large numbers of \nindividuals and can be partially offset by CIS.  \n\nSERIAL 4-01-02 \n4–01–02 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Donor \nComponent  Recipient Component  \nMaritime (M)  Land(L)  Air (A) Special \nForces (SF)  Logistics \n(Log)  \nMaritime  MLE(L) MLE(A) (As Req)  (As Req)  \nLand  LLE(M) LLE(A) (As Req)  (As Req)  \nAir ALE(M)  ALE(L)  ALE(SF)  ALE(Log)  \nSF (As Req)  SF(LO)  SOLE  NA \nLog (As Req)  (As Req)  (As Req)  (As Req)  \nTable  1:  of Liaison between Components - Key: ALE: Air Liaison Element; LLE: Land Liaison \nElement ; LO: Liaison Officer; MLE: Maritime Liaison Element.  \nAir Component Liaison  with JTFHQ .  \n2.5.

What  are Rules of Engagement ?  Rules of E ngagement (ROE) are the \nauthorisation for, or limits on, the use of force during military operations.  While ROE  must be \nlawful, they are a statement of policy that provides political direc tion for the conduct of \nmilitary operations, inc luding authorisations for, and lim itations on, the threat or  use of force \nor actions which might be construed as provocative.  ROE do not lim it the inherent right of \nself-defence in any  situation. \n3.2. How ar e ROE w ritten?  Formulation of R OE is influenced by  a variety of factors.  \nROE f irst must be lawful.  International l aw de fines t he lawful l imits f or the use of f orce \nduring military oper ations.

Force used must be l imited t o the degr ee, intensity,  and duration necessary \nto achieve  the obj ective.  Miscalculations ca n make the situation worse.    \n3.4. ROE i n Armed conflict .  Following commencement o f armed co nflict, t he law of \narmed co nflict appl ies.  Commanders w ill continue to use  the policies an d procedures to \nauthorise and i mplement r equired R OE af ter a commencement o f armed c onflict.  In such \ncases,  ROE generally lim it or restrict  the ot herwise lawful use  of force in accordance  with \nlaw of a rmed co nflict.  ROE requested and authorised must  not unduly r estrict, beyond the \nrestrictions i mposed by i nternational l aw, t he commander’s ability t o effectively ca rry ou t the \nmission and obtai n Military A dvantage.   \n3.5. Political P olicy Statement ( PPS) and P olitical Poli cy Indicators ( PPI).  With each  \nROE pr ofile is  a PPS.  This  gives su ccinct na rrative guidance on i ts political pol icy to enable \ncommanders t o respond appropriately as a situation develops.   The P PS will be explained in \nplain language and reflect  the overall pol icy aim to frame t he aut horised ROE i n the proper \ncontext  for the m ission. The PPS m ay ch ange as m ission objectives  and ROE aut horisations \nmatur e to reflect ch anges i n policy.  The PPS w ill be complemented b y Political Policy  \nIndicators (PPls)  which clarify t he trends r egarding the f oreseeable or exp ected development \nof the situation. These  PPls ar e divided into 3 ca tegories X , Y and Z according t o the \nfollowing cr iteria: \na. XRAY  - De-escalation.  Political/military strategy is to minimize involvement in\nthe crisis to that necessary to achieve the aim.\nb. YANKEE  - Maintain status quo .  Political/military strategy is to use forces to\nmaintain current regional balance or return to previous status quo following\ndestabilisation. Significant use of force to support specific objectives may be\nauthorised under PPI Yankee.\nc. ZULU  - Risk of Escalation is Acceptable .  Political/military strategy is to\nauthorise the use of force to support achievement of the grand strategy includingchange of the status quo ante to generate a more favourable environment. Implicit inthe approval of PPI ZULU is political recognition that military action may lead to\nescalation of the crisis.\nSERIAL 4-01-03 \n4–01–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 3.6. ROE Structure .  The ROE are written as a series of prohibitions and permissions \napplicable to activities in a wide range of military operations.  \na. Prohibitions .  When  issued as prohibitions, the rules are orders to commanders\nnot to take the  designated action(s).\nb. Permissions.  When issued as permissions, they define the limits of the threat\nor use of force, or of actions which might be construed as provocative, that\ncommanders may take to accomplish their mission.\nc. Unusual Circumstances.   The ROE  document is, however, only  drawn from a\nm\nenu of possible options.  The specific circumstances of each operation may require\nthat nations or commanders propose for approval ROE not listed in the normal\ndocument.\n3.7. Requesting, Authorising & Implementing ROE .  Based on the OPLAN, the \nmission and tasks, and the development of the situation, the Joint commander will consider \nthe appropriate ROE to be implemented in support of mission accomplishment.  There are 3 \nparts to the process:  \na. ROE Request Message (ROEREQ) .  Sent by requesting HQ up the chain of\ncommand to ask for ROE or change existing ROE.\nb. ROE Authorisation message (ROEAUTH) .  Sent by the strategic ( or ROE\nAuthorising) HQ to the Joint Task Force Commander with its decision.\nc. ROE Implementation message (ROEIMPL) .  Issued by the Joint Task Forc e\nC\nommander to the JTFHQ and components implementing the authorised ROE.\n3.8. Detailed Procedures .  Detailed procedures to amplify ROE guidance may be \nrequired to be promulgated by force or formation commanders for the following actions and \noperations which could lead to the use of force:  \na. Challenging procedures.\nb. Issuing warnings.\nc. Use of warning shots.\nd. The conduct of demolition operations.\ne. The conduct of cordon and/or search operations.\nf. The operation of check points.\ng. The designation and operation of secure areas.\nh. Weapons release authority.\ni. Other operations as may be required by the local situation.\nUse of deadly force in support of civil law enforcement functions is a particularly sensitive issue and in preparing the ROE all force options should be considered.  \n3.9. Dormant ROE .  Dormant ROE allow the chain of command to plan, prepare orders, \ntraining and materiel to be used once the dormant ROE become operative.  Dormant ROE are approved by the authorising HQ, but only  become operative at a particular milestone  or \nset of circumstances.  Such ROE are useful in rapidly evolving operational circumstances and authority for release of the ROE can be delegated to the appropriate level (ie component \ncommander) for rapid response to events.  When this happens, the chain of co mmand must \nbe informed immediately.  \nSERIAL 4-01-03 \n4–01–03 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 3.10.  Example Rule of Engagement .

International law principally governs relations between \nstates.  It is sometimes known as public international law or the law of nations.  \n4.2. Scope of International Law .  International law governs international relations both \nin time of peace and in time of armed conflict.  It covers, for example, the delimitation of \ninternational boundaries, international trade, the law of the sea, air and space law, human \nrights, protection of the environment, and diplomatic relations.  It also regulates the \ncircumstances in which states may use armed force (traditionally termed ‘jus ad bellum’) and \nthe way in which armed force is actually used (traditionally termed ‘jus in bello’ or ‘the law of \nwar’). \n4.3. War or Armed conflict ?  The term ‘armed conflict’, rather than ‘war’, is preferred \ntoday because it is wider in scope than the term ‘war’ which was, and indeed still is, a \ntechnical term with certain legal implications.  The Geneva Conventions refer to ‘cases of \ndeclared war or of any other armed conflict’.   A formal declaration of war is not required to \nbring the law of armed conflict into effect.  It applies whenever there is an armed conflict \nbetween states or a belligerent occupation of all or part of the territory of another state, even if it is not resisted by armed force.  Armed conflict can be defined as:  \n• ‘any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of\nmembers of the armed forces is an armed conflict’; or\n• ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force betw\neen\nS\ntates or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organis ed\nar\nmed groups within a State’.\n4.4. When does the LOAC Apply?   The law of armed conflict applies from the \nbeginning of an armed conflict until the general close of military operations.  However, in the \ncase of occupied territories, its application continues until the termination of the occupation, \neven if military operations, if any, ceased at an earlier date.   One of the most important \ncharacteristics of the law of armed conflict is its universal application.  It applies with equal \nforce to all parties engaged in an armed conflict, whether or not any party is considered to be \n‘an aggressor’ or ‘a victim of aggression’.  \n4.5. The use of Force  by States.  Charter of the United Nations 1945 (UN Charter), \nArticle 2, para 4, requires  States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or \nuse of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.  There are \nexceptions to this prohibition:  \n• First, the Security Council of the United Nations (UN) may authorize the use of\nforce, under Ch VII of the UN Charter, if it determines that there is in existence a threat\nto the peace, breach of the peace, or an act of aggression.\n• Second, states have the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an\narmed attack occurs, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary t o\nm\naintain international peace and security (Art 51 of the UN Charter).  They must\nimmediately report the measures taken to the Security Council.\n4.6. Individual Requirement to Comply with the Law of Armed Conflict  (LOAC) .  \nRegardless of the justification for or the legitimacy of any resort to force, individual members \nof the armed forces must act in accordance with the law of armed conflict. If they fail to do \nso, they will be acting illegally.  \n4.7. Purpose of the LOAC .  The main purpose of the law of armed conflict is to protect \ncombatants and non -combatants from unnecessary suffering and to safeguard the \nfundamental human rights of persons who are not, or are no longer, taking part in the conflict \n(such as prisoners of  war, the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked) and of civilians.  \nSERIAL 4-01- 04 \n4–01– 04 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 4.8. Components of LOAC .  The law of armed conflict was traditionally divided into two \nparts, each  named after the city where much of the law was devised. \n• Hague law  was largely concerned with how military operations are conducted;\n• Geneva law was concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict.\nThe two bodies of law have now merged.  However, there is still a distinction  between the \nlaw relating to armed conflicts between states, known as international  armed conflicts, and \narmed conflicts within the territory of a state,  known as internal (or non -international) armed \nconflicts. \n4.9. Sources of LOAC .  The law of armed conflict is to be found in:  \n• Customary Law —rules developed from the practice of states which are bindi ng\non s\ntates generally; and\n• Treaty Law —rules expressly agreed upon by states in international treaties\nwhich are only binding on states party to those treaties.\n4.10.  Neutrality .  The traditional law of neutrality defines the relationship under \ninternational law between states engaged in an armed conflict and those that are not \nparticipating in that conflict.  Traditionally, the law has incorporated the principle of non -\nparticipation in armed conflict and also impartiality in certain dealings with the belligerents.  \n4.11.  Basic Principles of the Law of Armed Conflict .  Four fundamental principles still \nunderlie the law of armed conflict. The law of armed conflict is consistent with the economic \nand efficient use of force.  It is intended to minimize the suffering caused by armed conflict \nrather than impede military efficiency  \n• Military Necessity .  Military necessity permits a state engaged in an arme d\nc\nonflict to use only that degree and kind of force, not otherwise prohibited by the law of\narmed conflict, that is required in order to achieve the legitimate purpose of t he\nc\nonflict, namely the complete or partial submission of the enemy at the earliest\npossible moment with the minimum expenditure of life and resources.\n• Humanity .  Humanity forbids the infliction of suffering, injury, or destruction not\nactually necessary for the accomplishment of legitimate military purposes.• Distinction .  Since military operations are to be conducted only against th\ne\nenem\ny’s armed forces and military objectives, there must be a clear distincti on\nbet\nween the armed forces and civilians, or between combatants and non- combatants,\nand between objects that might legitimately be attacked and those that are protected\nfrom attack.\n• Proportionality .   The principle of proportionality requires that the losses\nresulting from a military action should not be excessive in relation to the expect ed\nm\nilitary advantage.\n4.12.  Combatants and Non -combatants .  The law of armed conflict protects members \nof the civilian population by making a distinction between combatants, who take part in the \nfighting, and non -combatants, who do not take part in the fighting and who must be shielded, \nas far as possible, from its effects. \n• Combatants  have the right to attack and to resist the enemy by all the methods\nnot forbidden by the law of armed conflict.  Combatants are obliged to distinguis h\nt\nhemselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or i n a\nm\nilitary operation preparatory to an attack.\n• Non-combatants, by contrast, are not permitted to take a direct part in hostilities\nand are liable to trial and punishment if they commit, or attempt to commit, hostile acts.\nSERIAL 4 -01-05 \n4-01-05 - 1\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 COMBAT EFFECTIVNESS - LAND  \nReference:  \nA. AFM Vol 1 Warfighting Tactics Part 3 Brigade Tactics.\nB. UK Divisional Standard Operating Procedures .\nINTRODUCTION  \n5.1 One of the responsibilities of the commander is to consider the implications of  Combat \nEffectiveness on any proposed tactical actions , and on the levels of logistic support necessary to \nmaintain a unit’s or formation’s combat effectiveness (CE).  CE is defined as: ‘The ability of a unit \nor formation, or equipment to perform assigned missions or functions ’. \n5.2 The assessment of CE  should consider  both quantit ative (measurable facts ) and subjective \nqualitative (military judgement) analysis  and may be expressed as a level or percentage . \n• Quantitative Assessment  (Measure) .  Combat Power is a qualitative measure.\nCombat Power is defined as ‘the total means of destructive and/or disruptive force whic h a\nm\nilitary unit/formation can apply against the opponent at a given time’.   This is a\nmeasurement of unit personnel strength, equipment  and logistic status against planni ng\nbas\nelines.\n• Qualitative Assessment\n(Judgement) .  Leadership, unit\npersonnel knowledge, situati on on\nt\nhe ground, training,  and morale.\n5.3 These variables can be \nsummarised in the schematic here  \nusing the fighting power model . \nQuantitative  measurable variables are \nunderlined, qualitative military judgment \nones  are not . \nCATEGORIES OF COMBAT \nEFFECTIVENESS \n5.4 CE reflects the ability of a \nformation to perform assigned missions \nor functions  (in a particular \ntime/space/terrain) , it can  be broken \ndown into categories as follows : \n• Green  (100 – 80% CE ).  The formation/unit  is fully combat effective and has  no\nc\nonstraints on operations in the next 72 hours. There are no recognised problems that\nprevent normal progress either immediately or in the foreseeable future. No actions outside\nof the normal operation procedure are required and no command decision needed.\n• Amber  (60 – 80% CE).  The formation/unit is currently combat effective but there may\nbe some limitations on future operations beyond 48 hours.  In this case the formation must\n\nSERIAL 4 -01-05 \n4-01-05 - 2\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 explain what the limitations will be and predict how and when the situation is likely to change.  \nThis assessment indicates that there is a problem and that although is not severe enough to \nprevent progress at this time, it is likely to change to RED in the future unless a distinct action or decision is made.  The action may be as simple as monitor closely or continue with \nreduced capability; however, a distinct action or command decision is still required in addition \nto the normal operation procedures. \n• Red (40 – 60% CE).  The formation /unit is only partially combat effective, havi\nng an\ni\nmmediate limitation on operations.  The formation must explain the limitations and forecast\nwhether the situation will improve or deteriorate.  This assessment indicates that there is a\nproblem that is severe enough to prevent normal progress in this particular area.  A distinct\naction or command decision is required to permit positive progress to continue.• Black (less than 40% CE).  The formation/unit  is combat non -effective and should not\nbe used for operations.  The formation should explain the current limitations and the acti\non\nbei\nng taken to improve the situation.  This assessment indicates that there is a problem that\nis severe enough to prevent progress in this particular area and that there is no immediat e\ns\nolution available to rectify the situation.  A distinct action or command decision is required to\neither remove/ignore the particular parameter or to put measures in place that may rectify t he\npar\nameter over a period of time.\n5.5 The commander’s assessment of the combat effectiveness of his formation/unit is based on \nhis personal knowledge of his organisation and may only be partially based on factual information. \nCommanders of subordinate units are responsible to state in their daily reports their assessment of \nthe unit CE. This allows the superior HQ to assess its ability to perform its mission. Whenever the \nstatus of the unit CE changes (moves from one colour to another, in either direction) Commanders \nare to report that situation to the HQ.  The table below summarises the measurement of CE:  \nSer Category  Functional \nStatus  CE \nCapability  Operational \nAssessment Criteria  \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) \n1 GREEN  No/light \ndamage  100 – 80% \nCE Fully \nOperational  Able to carry out the majority \nof functions for which the unit \nwas designed.  \n2 AMBER  Moderate \ndamage  60 – 80% \nCE Largely \nOperational  Able to carry out the basic \nprimary  functions, but with \nsome degradation.  \n3 RED  Severe \nDamage 40 – 60% \nCE Minimal \nOperational  Able to carry out some of the  \nfunctions, but suffering from  \nsignificant degradations  \n4 BLACK  Functionally \ndestroyed  less than \n40% CE  Non-\noperational Unable to carry out any of the \nfunctions for which the unit was originally designed \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 1 \nOr\niginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 JOINT INTELLIGENCE  \nThis serial is a summary of :  JDP 2 -00 (4th  Edition) dated Aug 2023.  Intelligence, Counter -\nIntelligenc e & Security Support to Joint Operations.  \n1.1. The Relationship between Intelligence & Understanding .  (JDP 2 -00 from Para \n1.8) \n•Understanding  comes from applying judgement to knowledge to gain a deeper level\nof awareness of a situation and implications for the future. Judgement is a purely\nhuman skill, based on experience, expertise and intuition. Understanding,  therefore,\nconcerns acquiring, developing and applying knowledge to prioritise information\nrequirements, make sense of a given context, make better decisions,  and adapt and\ninfluence behaviours.\n•Intelligence is a Joint Function (See SOHB Serial 1- 02-01) and plays a critical role\nby providing the processed information required to develop understanding. This\nincludes not only answering the main intelligence questions of who, what, where,\nwhen, why and how, which provide the context and narrative of events, but also the\ndeductive and predictive analysis (also known as insight and foresight), which\nprovides the added  value in an assessment.\n1.2. The Aims of Intelligence: (JDP 2 -00 from Para 1.10)  \n•Enable Understanding .  Understanding of the operating environment and\naudiences, including their  intentions, capability and motivation.\n•Provide support to strategy formulation.   By providing support and assessments\nto generate understanding of the operating environment, including adversaries and\nneutral actors’ capabilities and intent.\n•Produce predicive assessments .  These should be forward looking, enabling\ncommanders to maintain the initiative.\n•Pr\novide indicators & warnings.   Detect and report time -sensitive intelligence and\ninformation on developments that could involve or constitute a threat. It includes\nforewarning of actions or intentions.\n•Intelligence monitoring .  This provides an intelligence baseline on countries,\nregions and actors before a crisis arises\n1.3. Princi ples of Intelligence: (JDP 2 -00 from Para 2.2) Intelligence at all levels is \nguided by 8 enduring principles. These should govern the mindset, organisation and \nactivities of those involved.  \n•Command (or\ndecision-\nmaker) ledSetting the conditions for effective  intelligence is a fundamental responsibility \nof command. C ommanders must express their critical information and \nintelligence  requirements  and resource the capability.  \n•ObjectivityIntelligence should always be unbiased . Intelligence staff should not distort \nassessments to fit  preconceived ideas or to provide answers that they think \ncommanders or  planners want  \n•PerspectiveAlternative perspectives reinforce objectivity. Even facts  supported by strong \nevidence will be contested by others and understanding somebody’s \nperception can be as important as understanding the facts.  \n•AgilityIntelligence staff should continuously adapt their activities to  the changing \nenvironment and the requirements of their commanders. This  particularly \nimplies mental and organisational agility. Agility is further supported by \nresilience, adaptation and flexibility.  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •TimelinessIntelligence should be delivered in time. It is better to provide  80% of the \nintelligence in time, with appropriate caveats on confidence levels,  than \n100% of the intelligence too late  \n•CollaborationSharing individual understanding to achieve greater  collective and common  \nunderstanding is a powerful tool in joint and coalition operations. The ‘need \nto know’ principle may endure to maintain security,  but a collaborative \nenvironment relies on a ‘duty to share’ culture across and possibly outside \ngovernment, underpinned by pragmatic risk management . \n•ContinuityExperience is gained slowly but can be lost quickly. Some  skills are enduring \nand transferable, particularly in ongoing operations.  Maintaining access to \nsubject matter experts is one way to achieve continuity  of understanding.  \n•SecuritySecurity permeates the entire intelligence enterprise. Security  risks are \nmitigated by technical measures, enforcing rules and procedures,  discipline \n(including self -discipline) and effective counter -intelligence operations . \n1.4. Additional NATO principles .  NATO principes are broadly similar to the UK principles. \nHowever, NATO has the following additions : \n•Interoperability. Common or interoperable processes, networks and systems are\nrequired to support intelligence direction, collection, processing and dissemination.\nThey are also required to manage the intelligence organisation.\n•Sharing/collaboration. Intelligence has the capability to draw on the skills of a wi de\ns\npectrum of experts and specialists in a variety of organisations, across all\ncommands and at all levels of operations. It should be noted that any sharing ofintelligence with foreign authorities must comply with domestic and international law\nand guard against shared intelligence contributing to unacceptable conduct.\n•Accessibility . Relevant information and intelligence must be processed by\nintelligence staff and be readily available to intelligence users. Intelligence is of\n no\nv\nalue if it is not disseminated or accessible to those who require it.\n•Anticipation . Intelligence is as much about warning and forecasting possible futur e\ndev\nelopments for decision- makers as it is about delivering for current circumstances\n1.5. The Levels of Intelligence. (JDP 2 -00 from Para 2.12)  \nStrategic \nIntelligence  Defined as:  ‘intelligence required for the formation of policy, military planning and \nthe provision of indicators and warnings at the national and/or international levels. ’ \nThis is typically gathered in response to government  requirements, focusing on \nnational threats, supra- national issues and conflict drivers. The nature of strategic \nintelligence means that a wide variety of intelligence sources and assets outside \nnational capabilities  are used.  \nOperational \nIntelligence  Defined as:  ‘intelligence required for the planning and conduct of campaigns at the  \noperational level.’  The primary users of this type of intelligence are operational -level \ncommanders and decision- makers with a specific area  of responsibility.  \nTactical \nIntelligence  Defined as: ‘intelligence required for the planning and execution of operations at \nthe tactical level. Tactical intelligence normally supports specific activities by \ntactical -level \ncommanders or units. ’  In most cases, intelligence assets providing tactical  \nintelligence belong to the tactical headquarters involved \nNon-military views of the strategic, operational and tactical . Commanders and intelligence staff \nmust consider that non- military  organisations may have different definitions for strategic, \noperational and tactical levels. This is especially true when working with civilian organisations  and \nlaw enforcement agencies.  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.6. The Limitations of Intelligence  Assessment .  (JDP 2 -00 from Para 2.15) \n•Human judgement . Human beings have limits making exacting analytical\njudgements in complex and rapidly changing environments. This impacts not only\nassessment but also decisions made because of them.  Intelligence may also not\nmeet the commander’s requirements exactly or be entirely accurate, complete or\neasily corroborated, but the commander will have to make judgements and decisions\nbased on it .\n•Audience intentions. It has always been exceptionally difficult to determi ne an\nadv\nersary’s intentions. In the contemporary and future operating environments,\nwhere the size of an adversary’s military capability may be less relevant due to\nunconventional or hybrid tactics, intelligence staff should ensure that commanders\nunderstand the increased difficulty of determining an adversaries’ and other\naudiences’ capabilities and intentions.\n•Extent of available a sset capability . All collection, exploitation and processi ng\nas\nsets have limitations. These limitations may arise from availability, volume and the\nability/capacity to process, exploit or disseminate in a timely manner.  Intelligenc e\ns\ntaff must closely engage with the ISR staff for a realistic appraisal of collection,\nexploitation and processing capability. Information obtained rarely provides  a\nc\nomplete picture and any sources of information must be liable to doubt a nd\naddi\ntional scrutiny.\n•Relevance/obsolescence. All intelligence is time -bound and subject to expiry.\nConstant evaluation and updating of the existing current intelligence, as well as the\nproduction of new intelligence, will preserve relevance of information given to\ncommanders and their staff. The continuous updating of basic intelligence is als o\nnec\nessary.\n•Source protection. Source protection is critical where sensitive or covert collecti on\nc\napabilities are involved. However, source protection should not become a reason for\nwithholding intelligence from those who need to know. The compromise of a sourc e\nc\nould result in the information no longer being available, the source being used to\npass deceptive information or the source being physically harmed or removed. Often,authority for release for information derived from sensitive or covert collecti\non\nc\napabiliti es will be controlled through higher authorities, including potentially at the\nnational level.\n•Management of Expectations . Even when exploited fully, intelligence will not\nproduce complete certainty. Intelligence staff must be realistic about what intelligenc e\nac\ntivity can achieve and they must manage the commander’s expectations whil e\ndoi\nng all they can to optimise available resources. .\n1.7.

J2 Intelligence Branch Staff Responsibilities. (JDP 2 -00 Table  6.1) \n•Maintain a thorough knowledge of understanding and intelligence doctrine,\nintelligence capabilities and their limitations.\n•Develop detailed intelligence plans and provide advice based on a sound intelligenc e\nes\ntimate and intelligence collection plan, as well as providing support to campai gn\nand ot\nher operational planning.\n•Participate in all joint inter -agency and military planning conducted by the combi ned\nj\noint task force headquarters.\n•Ensure all intelligence is set within the wider framework of understanding and itmeets the commander’s requirements.\n•Integrate national, theatre, operational and allied/coalition intelligence support.\n•Build and maintain a dynamic, agile and adaptable operational intelligenc\ne\nar\nchitecture based on the principles of collaboration and fusion, optimising\nreachback.\n•Synchronise J2 planning and operational planning for all operations.\n•Develop and maintain an intelligence concept of operations that supportscommanders at all levels.\n•Ensure intelligence unity of effort and continuity to the lowest levels.\n•Organise for continuous operations.\n•Ensure access to intelligence.\n•Continuously review all intelligence.\n1.10.  Counter -Intelligence.   Counter -intelligence is defined as: those activities \nconcerned with identifying and counteracting the threat to security posed by hostile intelligence services or organisations or by individuals engaged in espionage, sabotage,  \nsubversion or terrorism.   Counter -intelligence is an all -source intelligence function that \nprovides commanders at all levels with a detailed understanding of threats and \nvulnerabilities to enable them to make well -informed decisions on security , intelligence \ndisciplines and activities .  \n1.11.  Generic Intelligence and Information Requirements. Any  HQ Staff must set the \nparameters for their intelligence and information requirement to support operations planning \nand execution ; stating  what they  wants to know and by when.  They  need to discuss:  \n•What do we want to understand and how soon?\n•What do we know?\n•What are the potential gaps in our knowledge?\n•How do we fill those gaps?\n•How do we exploit our knowledge?\n1.12.  Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs) .  Information \nconcerning areas that are either critical to the success of the mission , or represent a \ncritical threat  are expressed as CCIRs.  CCIRs can range across all of the Information \nand intelligence requirement categories above and so are not always just intelligence \nfocused.  The  fewer the CCIRs, the better ; so the staff can focus its efforts and allocate \nscarce resources.  CCIRs are  always : \n•Specified by the commander for each mission or operation.\n•Related to planned decisions.\n•Applicable only to the commander who specifies them.\n•Situation dependent - directly linked to present and future missions.\n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Time sensitive. Answers to CCIRs must be immediately reported to the commander\nby any communications system available.\n•Always included in operational staff work (OSW).\n1.13.  Categories of Inf ormation & Intelligence Requirements . (JDP 2 -00 from Para \n3.7) IRs are sub- divided into categories : \n•Information Re quirements. Information about an adversary or potentially hostile  \nactors and other relevant aspects of the operational environment that needs to be  \ncollected and process ed to meet the intelligence requirements of a c ommander’ \nInformation requirements consist of the following:\noSpecific Information Requirements (SIR). Specific information requirements \ndescribe the information required, the location where the required information \ncan be collected and the time during which they can be collected’.\noEssential Elements of Information (EEI). Commander’s critical information  \nrequirements can be broken down into more manageable ess ential  \ninformation requirements , which clarify points for collection and analys is. They \nare bounded by time and location and provide focused specific questions or \ntasks for collectors.\noRequest for information (RFI). A unit can issue an information requirement \nto another organisation as a request for information when it does not hav e \nsufficient allocated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance resources.  \nA formalised RFI management proc ess manages the flow of RFIs and  \nresponses.\n•Intelligence Re quirements. The portion of the CCIRs that intelligenc e staff will seek  \nto ans wer are referred to as intelligenc e requirements . Intelligence requirements  \narticulate gaps in knowledge that must be filled or levels of understanding that must  \nbe maintained (enduring intelligence requirement) so that a commander can conduct  \nplanning.  Intelligence requirements may be further c ategorised as follows:\noPriority Intelligence Requirements (PIR).  Some intelligence requirements  \nwill be critical to the planning and conduct of operations. These are  \ndesignated priority intelligence requirements. They are those intelligence  \nrequirements for which a commander has a stated priority for planning and  \ndecision-m aking.\noEnduring intelligence requirements. Intelligence requirements that require  \nregular and repeated s atisfaction over time. (UK Term) \n1.\n14. (Joint ) Intelligence Preparation of the Operat ating Environment  (JIPOE ).  This is \na continuous process that seeks , with  to inform the  comprehensive understanding of the \noperating environment (CUOE ) and forms the basis for the development of the joint \nintelligence estimate.  It produces a dynamic product that focuses intelligence effort and \ninforms prioritisation of intelligence requirements.   The JIPOE promotes situational \nawareness and highlights future requirements for intelligence and should.   The process is \ndescribed in SOHB Serial 3- 01-05.   \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 JOINT INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE \nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT (JIPOE)  \nArea Evaluation Threat Evaluation Threat Integration \nPhysical Terrain \nAnalysis  Adversary Analysis Adversary aims & \nobjectives  \nA ctor Analysis Adversary COAs \n1.15.  Comprehensive Understanding of the Operating Environment ( CUOE ). The \nCUOE is a combination of the information environment assessment, the JIPOE and other \nstakeholder analysis/engagement.  \n1.\n16. The (Joint ) Intelligence Estimate .  The outcome of the JIPOE process forms the \nbasis of the joint Joint intelligence estimate.   The principal outputs of the joint intelligence \nestimate are:  \n•An understanding of the operational environment and actors;\n•An assessment of the adversary’s capabilities, intent and opportunities based on t he\nav\nailable intelligence;\n•Identification of the adversary’s probable COAs and the probability of  their adoption;\nFigure 1.1 Comprehensive Understanding of the Operating Environment  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Providing commanders with the intelligence required for the operational estimate;\n•Proving the start point for intelligence planning by identifying intelligenc e\nr\nequirements; and\n•Highlighting the intelligence- sharing requirements between nations to  support the\noperation.\n1.17.  Intelligence Support to Planning. (JDP 2 -00 from Para 7.1) Intelligence staff \nsupport the joint operational estimate planning process. Intelligence staff must remain \ncognisant of the commander’s requirements as they evolve, so the commander must include \nthe intelligence staff in all aspects of planning.   The sequence of J2 activities  to support \nplanning is: \n•Step 1 – Initiation . Initiation reviews the inputs from the strategic level, higher\nheadquarters and within J2 it initiates the JIPOE. Initiation focuses on conducti ng an\noper\national area evaluation, threat identification and threat area evaluation, and will\nreview the physical terrain and the information environment. Within the threat\nevaluation, the intelligence staff will seek to understand the adversary and conduct\nanalysis of the span of actors within the operational environment. Threat integrati on\nwil\nl seek to identify adversary aims and objectives and will consider potential enemy\nCOAs .\n•Step 2 – Mission Analysis.  The mission analysis stage takes the product from t he\ni\nnitial JIPOE and develops it further  by identifying and analysing the problem through\nthe conduct of the joint intelligence estimate.  Mission analysis will include:\noanalysing the impact of the operational environment;\noidentifying gaps in the deployed intelligence architecture;\noidentifying the specific and implied intelligence tasks;\noreviewing the availability and capabilities of intelligence assets;\nodetermining the commander’s initial critical information requirements;\nodetermining the limitations of intelligence support;\noproposing acceptable risk guidelines;\noconducting a thorough timeline estimate.\n•Step  3 – Course of Action Development .  In addition to supporting the COA teams\nwork the J2 staff will develop the detail of the primary actors’ most likely and most\ndangerous COAs for the staff to plan against.\n•Step 4 – Course of Action Analysis .  Intelligence input to COA development  and\nev\naluation includes the following:\noConducting a review of the situation and environmental characteristics,\nconcentrating on those aspects that have changed since the initial COAs\nwere developed.\noA detailed description, in priority order, of the threats for each COA from most\nlikely to least likely and from most dangerous to least dangerous.\noIntelligence staff support to any wargaming the commander requires.   The\ni\nntelligence staff provide the overall context for the operation and represent\nthe various actors, especially adversaries  in wargaming .\noUpdating understanding through responses to the CCIR and other informati on\nrequi\nrements.\n•Step 5 – Course of Action Validation & Comparison.  J2 Support to assessment\nof COAs . This could include external to the HQ, ‘red team ’ analysis of each COA.\n•Step 6 – Commander’s Course of Action Decision.  The principal intelligenc e\nadv\niser has an important role in helping the commander decide which COA t o\nc\nhoose. Subsequently, a final intelligence assessment is required for the\ncommander’s planning directive  and/or warning order 3 .\n•Step 7 – Plan Development .  The J2 staff will support the propuction of t he\nS\nITUATION section of the OPLAN / or OPORD and finalise the Joint Intelligenc e\nE\ntimate  outputs  that will be issued as Annex  D.

(JDP 2 -00 from Para 3.1). \n1.\n18. The Intelligence \nCycle. There are four \noverarching core functions in \nthe intelligence cycle: \ndirection, collection, \nprocessing and dissemination (DCPD). \nInformation must be acquired \nfrom all sources available;  it \nmust be properly understood and its significance for decision- making assessed. \nAll of this must be conducted based on clear and \nmethodical requirements for \ninformation and the subsequent assessments \nmust be conveyed to those \nwho need them to support \ntheir decision- making. All \nthese activities take place \nconcurrently and  interact \nwith one another, overlap and coincide but, ultimately, they \nare intended to meet information \nrequirements provided by direction. As a result, they are often seen as an intelligence ‘cycle’, \nwith requirements from decision‑ makers giving direction to collection, analysis and \nprocessing with the final product being disseminated to decision- makers to meet those \nrequirements. The intelligence cycle is visualised at Figure 1.1.  \nDirection (Step 1 of Intelligence Cycle) (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3. 4) \n1.19.  Direction Overview .  Direction within the intelligence cycle is defined as: the \ndetermination of intelligence requirements, planning of collection effort, issuance of orders \nand requests to agencies and continuous monitoring of the productivity of such agencies.  \nThis involves the following activities.  \n•The commander  and their staff will begin to formulate Information and Intelligenc\ne\nr\nequirements , some of which will be  commander’s critical information requirements\n(CCIRs).\n•Ensuring intelligence requirements are captured, processed  and actioned by the ISR\nstaff for collection and process, exploit and disseminate activity.\nFigure 1.2 The Intelligence Cycle  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Monitoring intelligence activity to ensure that the right information, includi ng\ni\nndicators and warnings,  is being collected, analysed and disseminated.\n•Ensuring that intelligence activities are conducted in a timely manner  and wher e\ndel\nays are occurring, re -tasking or reprioritising as required.\n•Planning the production, in combination with intelligence requirements management\nand collection management (IRM&CM).\nCollection (Step 2 of Int elligence  Cycle ) (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3.1 8) \n1.20.  Collection Overview .  Collection may be described as the gathering and exploitation \nof data and information by specialists and agencies and the delivery of the results obtained \nto the appropriate processing unit for use in the production of intelligence.  It comprises \nsearch, retrieval and receipt of data, information and intelligence from external sources. \nCollection within the intelligence cycle does not refer to the application of sensors and collection capabilities against requirements; this falls within the ISR TCPED process. \nCollection refers to the harvesting of the results and outputs from the ISR process and other \nsources for use by intelligence staff and  analysts.  \n1.21.  Sources.   An Agency will \ncollect information from its own resources or from a source. There \nare 3 groups of sources, Controlled, \nUncontrolled, and Casual .     \n1.22.  Agencies . An agency is \ndefined as: in intelligence usage, an organisation or individual engaged in \ncollecting and/or processing information.  An agency is different \nfrom a source because a source \nproduces raw data while an agency, \nwhich has a collection capability, also \npossesses some degree of processing capability and can provide \nintelligence. Agencies can be \nnational (for example, State \nSecurity Bure au) or multinational \n(for example, NATO , CIA or MI6 ) \n1.23.  Timeliness is vital .  The agency  or source  must deliver information in the required \ntime.  This is defined either as Response Time (total time from initiation of RFI to receipt of  \nanswer) or Reporting Time (time from detection of information to analyst receiving it and \ntherefore able to start processing).  \n1.\n24  The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Collection Requirements \nList. The collection requirements list (CRL) is generated by the collection management staff \nand integrates requirements from both the operations staff and the intelligence staff. It aims to match requirements with specific collection assets and directly supports the intelligence \ncollection plan and the operational and targeting requirements. Having determined which assets best suit the task, collection m anagement . \nFigure 1.3 The Intelligence Collection Management Process  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.25 Relationship between the intelligence cycle and intelligence, surveillance and \nreconnaissance .  The ISR process is synchronised with the intelligence and operations  \ncycles.  Although the ISR process is frequently aligned with the collection and processing \nphases of the intelligence cycle, it is not exclusively aligned,  especially where ISR assets are \nsupporting operations directly and in real time.   Figure 1.4 illustrates the alignment of the ISR \nprocess and the intelligence and decision cycles.  \nProcessing ( Step 3 of Intelligence Cycle)  (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3. 30) \n1.26.  Processing ( and analysis) Overview .  Processing is defined as: the conversion of \ninformation into intelligence through collation, evaluation, analysis, integration and \ninterpretation.  Processing is the function of the intelligence cycle in which collected \ninformation and data is converted into intelligence to meet intelligence requirements. For \nclarity in this  doctrine, it has been subdivided into processing and analysis,  \n•Processing.  T he processing steps describing how information is made usable for\nthe analyst\n•Analysis.  A nalysis steps covering  how the analyst then makes this valuable for the\ncustomer.\nBoth steps  must occur to achieve the overall aim. Processing and analysis are iterative  and \nmay generate further collection requirements before the intelligence is  disseminated. .   \n1.27.  Processing.  Rarely can the information and data acquired during collection be \nunderstood without considerable effort. Processing forms the interface between collection and analysis, and between the ISR process and the intelligence cycle.   Processing within the \nintelligence cycle consists of collation, interpretation and evaluation. \nFigure 1.4 Showing the synchronisation  between the intelligence cycle and the ISR process . \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 11 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Collation .  Collation draws together information from disparate sources that ar e\nr\nelevant to the same intelligence requirement. It establishes the foundation for bot h\ni\nnterpretation and evaluation by providing a structure in which the informati on\ngat\nhered can be contextualised and cross -referenced and, in doing so, underpins\nanalysis\n•Interpretation .  Interpretation extracts meaning from collection products so they can\nbe fully and appropriately used during the analysis phase. These products may have\nbeen partially processed electronically beforehand, such as the conversion of ‘raw’\ntechnical data into imagery or searchable databases. Interpretation goes beyond this\nthough to draw out the relevance of information for later analysis.\n•Evaluation .  Evaluation is an appraisal of the quality of the reported information,\nwhich is key to determining the reliability of the originator or source and the credibility\nof the information.   During this process the intelligence is graded.  Evaluation is vital\nfor all aspects of intelligence analysis because it determines the weight that can  be\npl\naced on a specific source and its reporting when forming analytic judgements.\nSources must be evaluated for the accuracy and trustworthiness of their information,\nan activity sometimes referred to as validation.\nReliability of Source  Credability of Information  \nA    Completely reliable  1    Confirmed by other sources  \nB    Usually reliable  2    Probably true  \nC    Fairley reliable  3.Possibly true\nD    Not usually reliable  4    Doubtful  \nE    Unreliable  5    Improbable  \nF    Reliability cannot be judged  6    Truth cannot be judged  \n1.28.  Analysis.  Analysis  is principally human cognitive functions, depending on creative \nthinking to address gaps in information or understanding and critical thinking to assess \nimplications for the requirement.  Analysts should remain aware of, and consciously address, \nthe impact of  personal and subjective intellectual bias, adding structur al checks and enabling \nchallenge.  Analysis should also link back to processing as gaps are revealed or information \nFigure 1.5 Processing and Analysis within  the Intelligence Cycle  \nFigure 1.6 NATO Intelligence Grading System  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 12 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 needs to be re- evaluated in the light of links identified.  Analysis consists of synthesis, \nassessment and production: \n•Synthesis. Synthesis is achieved by identifying links, patterns and anomalies in t he\npr\nocessed information, resulting in descriptive explanations of what something does,\nhow it works, what is happening in a situation, etc.  As such, it can be an end in its\nown right, generating basic  and current intelligence.  However, it can also be used to\nunderpin assessments depending on the intelligence requirement.\n•Assessment . Assessment builds on synthesis to answer the linked questions of ‘s o\nw\nhat?’, ‘what next?’ and ‘what if?’. It involves making judgements about what t he\nex\nplanations mean for customers in the context  of their SIR, providing insight  and\nf\noresight. This is often associated with  predictive analysis, but also includes\njudgements about the implications of a  subject (for example, a particular capability,\nsituation or event) for a decision.   The two primary considerations for analysts in\nconducting assessment are probability  and their level of analytical confidence .\noProbability . Since assessments are generated using incomplete, potentially\nunreliable and/or unknowable information, judgements should include the\nprobability that each hypothesis is true or that outcomes (future hypotheses or \nscenarios) will occur. Defence Intelligence mandates the use of the \nuncertainty yardstick (see Fig 1.7  ), which indicates to customers a probability \nrange against a standardised qualitative term for each intelligence product  \noAnalytical confidence.  The main purpose of evaluating analytical\nconfidence is to enable articulation of the strengths and weaknesses of\nanalytical judgements. In addition to communicating this to decision-makers,\nevaluations of analytical confidence can be used for quality assurance and\npreparing for follow- up work as it highlights aspects of analysis that could be\ni\nmproved.  Analytical confidence is divided into three categories, each of\nwhich comprise different sets of criteria for evaluation.\nInformation base  – the information and sources on which an\nassessment is based.\nAnalytical rigour  – the analytical processes and tools/methods\napplied to the information.\nComplexity and volatility – the inherent properties of the\nenvironment being analysed (that may influence judgement stability).\n•Production . Production captures the results in forms that will clearly and effectively\ncommunicate those results and judgements to decision- makers.  Production lies  on\nt\nhe interface between processing and dissemination, and is integral to making\nanalysis truly valuable to customers.\nFigure 1.7 Assessment \nProbability Yardstick \nGraphic . \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 13 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Dissemination  (Step 4 of Intelligence Cycle) (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3. 49) \n1.29.  Dissemination Overview .  Intelligence is useless if it is given too late to those who \nneed it to act on it.  Dissemination is defined as: ‘ the timely conveyance of intelligence, in \nappropriate forms and means, to those who need it. ’  Getting intelligence to the user at the \nright time and in the appropriate format is essential for successful intelligence operations.    \n1.30.  Requirement Management . Requirement management is as vital in the \ndissemination phase as it is in direction and collection. Wherever possible, initial tasking \nshould include the requirement for direct dissemination and the means by which this should \nbe achieved.  \n1.31.  Dissemination  Management . It is important for intelligence staff to manage the \ndissemination process continuously. Without effective management, communications paths can become saturated by information.    \n1.32.  Push and Pull Principles.  The push concept allows for higher formations to push \ninformation down to lower levels of command to satisfy intelligence requirements and for \nlower levels of command to push intelligence upward.  The pull concept involves using cloud \nstorage, knowledge repositories, databases, intelligence files or other data and information repositories that are accessible to intelligence organisations at all levels of command. \nIntelligence products should be organised and presented using web- based technologies and \nuniversally recognised standards within Defence.  \n1.33.  Dissemination Methods. Intelligence is disseminated by three core methods: verbal \nbriefing, printed material and electronically.  Electronic means  of storing and accessing \ninformation have and will continue to develop at pace, thereby enhancing the ability of \nintelligence users at all levels to access  material directly rather than being reliant on \nreceiving cascaded information, data or assessments.  \n1.34.  Formatting . After determining who needs to receive each report, intelligence staff \nmust determine how much of the report each user requires and in what format.  \nConsiderations include the decision- makers requirements or preferences, user requirement, \nspeed of transmission, the available bandwidth, legal restrictions and security classification . \n1.35.  Principles of D issemination .  Dissemination is governed by the principles of: \nlatency, appropriateness, urgency, distribution and security : \n•Latency.  There are two aspects to latency. The first is when dissemination is toolate for an intended purpose and is thus redundant. The second refers to intelligenc\ne\nt\nhat is time sensitive, where accuracy decays or the information loses its value wit h\nt\nhe passage of time.\n•Appropriateness. Disseminated intelligence should enhance understanding and be\nin an accessible format. J2 staff will ensure the appropriateness of intelligence tomeet the user’s needs, and make  sure that it is intelligible and disseminated across a\nsuitable system.\n•Urgency. Whenever possible, information obtained to meet an intelligenc\ne\nr\nequirement should be converted into intelligence before dissemination. However,\nwhen time is at a premium, the full processing and analysis of information may not bepossible and dissemination should be undertaken as quickly as possible, with the\ncaveat that it is unprocessed and may not be reliable.\n•Distribution. Intelligence staff are responsible for ensuring that all intelligence is\ndisseminated to those who need it. The commander and intelligence staff mayrequire the distribution of additional summaries of intelligence to other agencies\n and\nf\normations outside the normal chain of command, such as partners across\ngovernment.\n4-02-01 \n4–02–01 - 14 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • Security .  Intelligence should be classified at the level required and not be over -\nclassified. Over -classification causes delays in handling and transmission. The use of \n‘tear-lines’ can balance the requirement to maintain security and protect the source \nwhilst allowing for the greatest possible distribution. There may be occasions when \nthe risk of compromising the source has to be weighed against the value of the \ninformation.  \n1.36.  NATO reporting formats. Uses NATO standards for report formats and message \nsets to guarantee multinational interoperability.Wherever possible, written and web- based \nintelligence reports should be consistent with the NATO formats in the Table.  \nREPORT  DESCRIPTION  \nIntelligence Report  \n(INTREP)  Sent whenever information or intelligence is urgent  and contains any \ndeductions that can be made in the time available. INTREPs can comprise \nthreat reporting  containing unprocessed data and information  \nIntelligence  \nSummary  \n(INTSUM)  A concise, periodic summary of intelligence about the  current situation within \nthe joint operations area. It is  designed to update the current intelligence \npicture and to highlight important developments during the reporting period \nand includes any information or  intelligence relevant to extant intelligence \nrequirements.  \nSupplementary  \nIntelligence Report  \n(SUPINTREP)  A stand -alone summary of intelligence for a given  subject or situation. It \nupdates the current intelligence picture, addressing a specific issue or \nhighlighting  important developments inside the normal reporting  cycle.  \nSingle -source \nReports  Other intelligence reports and summaries are  periodically generated to \naddress specific subjects,  for example, interrogation reports and technical  \nintelligence reports.  \nCounter ‑intelligence  \nReports  Similar to INTREPs, counter -intelligence (CI)  reports comprise CI -INTREPs, \nCI-INTSUMs and  CI‑SUPINTREPs. Counter -intelligence staff may also \nproduce threat assessments and threat warnings to  inform commanders of \nspecific security threats.  \nThematic Reports  These address aspects of the operating environment, such as a geographic \nlocation, a political or religious movement or a particular adversary \norganisation.  \n \nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 CYBER AND ELECTROMAGNETIC OPERATIONS  \nReference: UK Cyber Primer  3rd Edition . \n2.1. The Cyber and E lectromagnetic Domain .  The capabilities and activities relating  \nto cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment  are placed together as a single  \noperational domain.   The cyber and electromagnetic domain is defined as: “a domain \ncomprising capabilities  which enable activities that maintain freedom of action by creating \neffects in  and through cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum .” \n2.2. Cyber and Electromagnetic Operations.  Cyber and electromagnetic operations \ncomprise of a series of interrelated disciplines. \n•Cyber operations . Cyber\noperations concern planni ng and\ns\nynchronising activities i n and\nt\nhrough cyberspace to enabl e\nf\nreedom of manoeuvre and to\nachieve military objectives.\n•Information operations .\nI\nnformation operations may p lan\nt\no deliver information activities\nusing cyber operations\ncapabilities. Therefore,\ninformation operations staff must\nbe aware of the cyber capability\nof the force.\n•Electromagnetic operations .\nE\nlectromagnetic operations are\ndefined as: all operations that shape or exploit the electromagnetic  environment or  use it for attack or defenc\ne\ni\nncluding the use of  the electromagnetic environment to support operations in all\nother operational environments. Note: Electromagnetic operations include (but ar e\nnot\n limited to) electromagnetic warfare, signals intelligence, intelligence,\nsurveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, navigation warfare,\nbattlespace spectrum management.\n•Signals intelligence . Signals intelligence is defined as: intelligence derived from\nelectromagnetic signals or emissions. Note: the main subcategories of signals\nintelligence are communications intelligence and electromagnetic intelligence.\nCyber and signals intelligence are,  to an extent, reliant on similar infrastructures,\norganisations, accesses,  personnel training and skill sets.\n•Communication and information systems . Communication and informati on\ns\nystems are essential to facilitate the enable role of cyber  operations .\n2.3. Electromagnetic spectrum  (EMS) .  The EMS covers different types of electronic \nradiation from radio waves through visible light to gamma rays.  From a military perspective, \nthe EMS can be used indirectly, as a bearer for information, or directly as a means of creating an effect.  It is in the former that the EMS and cyber have their relationship as \nelectromagnetic energy enables the linking of computer networks and infrastructure.  \n2.4. What is Electronic Warfare (EW) ?  EW is defined as ‘military action that exploits \nElectro -Magnetic (EM) energy to provide situational awareness and achieve offensive and \ndefensive effects. It comprises the following electromagnetic activities:  \n•Electronic Attack (EA) . The use of EM energy for offensive purposes.\n•Electronic Defence (ED) . The use of EM energy to provide protection and to\nensure effective friendly use of the EM spectrum.\nFigure 2.1 Cyber and electromagnetic operating context\nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Electronic Surveillance (ES) . The use of EM energy to provide SA and\nintelligence.\n•Electronic Warfare Management .  This is the capability to coordinate and\ndeconflict electronic warfare activities and, as such, is fundamental to coordinati ng\nC\nEMA.\n2.5. EW Tasks.\n•Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) . ESM are actions taken to search\nfor, intercept, and identify EM emissions, and to locate their sources for th e\npur\npose of immediate threat recognition.\n•Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) . ECM are actions taken to prevent or\nreduce an enemy’s effective use of EMS through the use of EM energy.\no Electronic Jamming. Electronic jamming is the deliberate radiation, re-\nradiation or reflection of EM energy, with the object of impairing the\neffectiveness of electronic devices, equipment or systems being used by a n\nenem\ny.  Coordination of jamming is an operations staff responsibility execut ed\nby\n the EW staff in consultation with the Intelligence, Spectrum Management\n(SM) and wider CIS staff. It should be undertaken at the highest level of\ncommand, but control should be vested in the appropriate tactical\ncommander.\no Electronic Deception . Electronic deception is the deliberate radiation, re -\nradiation, alteration, absorption or reflection of EM energy in a mannerintended to confuse, distract or coerce an enemy or his electronic systems.  It\nmust be considered during the planning phase of any deception plan.\nDeception is an operations staff responsibility with assistance fromintelligence staff and the EW planning staff.  EW staff assist the intelligenc\ne\ns\ntaff in providing information on the enemy use of the EMS, their\nvulnerabilities, surveillance capabilities and the enemy’s reaction to deception.\no Electronic Neutralisation. Electronic neutralisation is ‘the deliberate use ofEM energy to either temporarily or permanently damage enemy devices whic\nh\nr\nely exclusively on the EMS’.  Electronic neutralisation is usually brought\nabout as a result of a Direct Energy Weapon (DEW) depositing sufficient EMenergy on a target to render it ineffective. For example, the use of lasers t\no\ndam\nage or destroy optical devices.\n•Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) . EPM are actions taken to ensur e\nef\nfective friendly use of the EMS despite the enemy’s use of EM energy.\no Active EPM . Active EPM involves the use of detectable protective measures,\nsuch as a change in frequencies or the re -radiation of a signal using reflectors\nor repeaters.\no Passive EPM . Passive EPM measures are undetectable to the enemy an d\ni\nnvolve:\n Reducing transmission power to a level which is sufficient to maintai n\nc\nommunications.\n Making maximum use of codes, ciphers and encryption.\n Careful siting and use of directional antennas to reduce the risk of\ndetection and degrade the accuracy of adversary DF.\n The use of SOPs to reduce the need for communications and keep EMemissions to a minimum.\n The use of SOPs for countering enemy jamming and deception.\n Strict Emission Control (EMCON) measures, which either forbid or limitEM emissions during certain phases of the battle.\nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 3 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16  – May 202 5 2.6. Cyberspace.  There are no universally accepted definitions  for cyber, however  the \nfollowing definition will be used: “The global environment consisting of all interconnected \ncommunication, information technology and other electronic systems, networks and their \ndata, including those which are separated or independent, which process, store or transmit \ndata. ” \n2.7. The Cyber Challenge .  The Armed Force’s  ability to conduct protective operations \nin cyberspace is mission critical, demands resilience and facilitates decision superiority. Our adversaries will contest our freedom of manoeuvre in cyberspace so we need to have \ncapabilities that can identify, pro tect, detect, respond and recover from attacks against our \ndigital systems and communication networks . \n2.8. The Layers of Cyberspace.  Cyberspace can be thought of as comprising  six \ninterdependent layers: social; people; persona; information; network and geographic. These \nlayers can be placed within three effect dimensions, as  shown in Figure 2 .2. below  \n2.9. How do you access Cyberspace?   Access to cyberspace is possible via many \nmeans, most often through computer terminals, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Connectivity may be achieved via wireless connections or physical cables. Cyberspace is \ndependent upon physical assets –  power sources, cables, networks, data -centres, as well as \nthe people who operate and manage them.  \n2.10.  How is Cyber used by Adversaries?   Cyberspace is permanently contested by \nour adversaries, who exploit areas such as:  \n• Corrupting and stealing sensitive information;  Figure 2.2 Layers of Cyberspace and their relationship with the 3 effects dimensions . \n\nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Denying services on telecommunications, commercial databases and websites;\n•Damaging industrial control systems (ICS) such as supervisory control and data\nacquisition systems (SCADA); distributed control systems (DCS) and\nprogrammable logic controls (PLC).\n2.11.  Forms and Methods of Cyber Attack .  The cyber toolbox includes (but is not \nlimited to) social engineering, malware, local physical access and supply chain corruption.  \n2.12.  Cyber Operations.  Cyber operations are  defined as: “ The planning and \nsynchronisation of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of manoeuvre and to achieve military Objectives ” There are four distinct but interdependent roles:  \n•Influence Role.\n•Defend Role.\n•Enable Role.\n•Inform  Role.\n2.13.  Influence Role .  The influence role enables cyber and electromagnetic capabilities \nto shape (defeat, deceive, degrade and deny) adversaries’  capabilities, which allows our \nforces  to mould the behaviour of audiences and the course of events .  There are four t ypes \nof missions/ activities : \n•Offensive Cyber Operations . These are defined as: “ activities that project power\nto achieve military objectives in or through cyberspace”.  They can be used to inflict\npermanent or temporary effects, thus reducing an adversary’s confidence in theirnetworks, information or other capabilities for a specific period.  Offensive cyber\nactivity is commonly broken into seven phases, known as the cyberattack chain.\nThe phases are not discrete events, instead they interact and overlap with eac\nh\not\nher and may vary in duration. They are equally applicable to the actions of a\nstate or criminal and are illustrated in Fig 2.3 below.\n•Cyber Information Operations.\n•Counter Cyber.\n•Electromagnetic Attack .\n2.\n14. Defend Role - Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO).   Defensive Cyber Operations  \nare defined as: “ active and passive measures  taken to prevent, nullify or reduce the \neffectiveness of adversary actions to  preserve our freedom of action in or through \ncyberspace ”.   \n•Active Defence: Activities that target hostile offensive cyber operations in order t o\npr\neserve  our freedom of manoeuvre within cyberspace.\n•Passive D efence : Threat specific defensive measures to reduce the effectiveness\nof cyber  activity.\n2.15.  Enable Role . Enable is a foundation role, is a vital function; it harnesses, manages \nand operates the communication and information systems infrastructure controlled by the \nArmed Forces.   Enable activities include: \n•Electromagnetic Spectrum Management,\n•Digital Service Integration and Management,\n•Network Operations.\n•Information Assurance.\n2.16.  Inform Role:  The inform role underpins all the other roles as it secures freedom of  \naction to engage with the cyber and electromagnetic domain. This is achieved through the \ndevelopment of appropriate knowledge and understanding. \nFigure 2.3 The Cyber Attack Chain  \nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Cyber ISR .

It is no coincidence , therefore,  that \nInformation  is both an  instrument of power , at the strategic level , and is one of the joint \nfunctions , at the operational and tactical levels , and as such forms part of Joint Action .  The \njoint force needs to understand  how information shapes the environment in which it operates  \nand how best to use information to influe nce and change behaviours , along with the other \njoint functions.    \n5.2 This serial will first consider what is influence, then  it will describe  how the joint force \nis organised to use information .  It will then go on to explain  Strategic Communications , \nInformation Operations and Psychological  Operations; Media Operations are described in \nSerial 4-02-06.   \n5.3 Influence Defined .  Allied Joint Doctrine for Information Operations defines influence  \nas: “The capacity to have an effect on the character or behaviour of someone or something\nor the effect itself”. \n5.4 Influencing Human Behaviour .  For any beh aviour to occur there  are three factors \nrequired: Capability, Opportunity and Motivation - see Figure 5.1 below.  Capability can be \npsychological (knowledge) or physical (skills); opportunity can be social (societal influences) \nor physical (environmental resources); motivation can be automatic(emotion) or reflective \n(beliefs, intentions) .  When these factors are analysed possible opportunities for attitude or \nbehaviour change through the use of information  can be identified .  Noting that humans \nreceive their information through a number of inputs , their senses and how they feel \nphysically, with the majority of information com ing through eyesight and hearing.   \nFigure 5.1: Capability  Opportunity Motivation  Behaviour  Model  (COM -B) (adapted)  \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 5.5 Military Influence is delivered by Joint Action .  The capacity that a military force \ncan use to influence are its elements of Joint Action: Manoeuvre, Fires, Information  and \nCIMIC .  The military force needs to understand where to deliver this capacity, at someone or \nsomething , and what behaviour or character it is seeking to change.    \n5.6 Strategic Communication – STRATCOM1.  NATO has recently introduced a \ncommand group function called Strategic Communication or STRATCOM  realising the \nimportance of the information environment to the current character of competition .  NATO \ndefines STRATCOM function as:  \n‘The integration of communication capabilities and the information staff function with \nother military activities, in order to understand and shape the information \nenvironment, in support of aims and objectives. ’\nThis function , which is used by all levels of command , is responsible for understanding the \ninformation environment across all relevant audiences and, based on that understanding, \nusing all means of communication – comprising actions, images and words – to \nappropriately  inform and influence an audience's attitudes and behaviours through a \nnarrative -led approach in pursuit of the desired end state.   \n5.7 STRATCOM Organisation .  The STRATCOM function comprises of four functional \nareas : STRATCOM, Information Operations, Psychological Operations and Media \nOperations  as sho wn on Figure 5.2.  \nFigure 5.2 STRATCOM functional areas  \n5.8 STRATCOM .  The STRATCOM cell provides the central staff for the STRATCOM \nfunction.  It receives and interprets the STRATCOM directive which is part of the Strategic \nPlanning Guidance .  On behalf of the commander it develops STRATCOM direction and \nguidance , which includes:  \na. STRATCOM frameworks  – these  are the primary direction and guidance\ndocuments for the planning and execution of activities .  It will typically contain: a\nnarrative and/or  core message; defined audiences; STRATCOM objectives;\nSTRATCOM these; focus topics; coordination and any additional annexes.\n1 STRATCOM is used as a noun  in this context  which describes a function .  The Strategic o r STRAT  \nelement of the phrase does not  relate to the strategic level of warfare.   NATO have introduced a new \nstaff branch, J10, as a focus for STRATCOM.  MAJCSC will not use the J10 branch  until it is adopted \nby the UK.      \n\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 b. STRATCOM Implementation Guidance.\nc. Integrated Communications Plans .\nd. Mission specific narratives .\ne. STRATCOM Annex to the OPLAN.\n5.9 Narratives .  A narrative is defined as ‘ A spoken or written account of events and\ninformation arranged in a logical sequence to influence the behaviour of a target audience. ’2 \nA narrative is a story designed to provide an emotive justification for a policy, and in many \ncases how that policy  is to be realised and the moral authority for doing so.  The policy is the \ndesire to move to a future state or maintain a current state (the ends).  The strategy is the \nplan to get to that state (employing ways and means to achieve the ends).  The narrati ve \nprovides the ‘ why? ’ It provides a justification for action, and a justification can be very \nsubjective.  \n5.10   Strategic Narrative .  The strategic narrative, written at the strategic level, must \nspeak to a broad swathe of audiences in a manner that allows them to understand it and be \npositively influenced by it, despite language and cultural differences.  Therefore, for Defence \nactivity to be effective, it requires sound strategy and a supporting narrative.  The narrative \nwill help guide planning and give meaning to actions, when perceived by audiences.  The \npervasive nature of information means the perception of activity is as important as the \nactivity itself. Narratives must compete to connect with audiences and to endure.   Narratives \nare usually strategic and written and held at this level.  Narratives can be written at lower \nlevels, such as the CJTF level but probably no lower.   A strategic narrative should comprise \nthe following elements:  \n• The current state : a description of the wrong to be righted or the desirable\ncondition to be retained.\n• The future state : a description of the ends, be it a maintenance of the current\nstate or a transition.\n• The pathway : how to get there.\n• The justification : why the proposed change of state, or maintenance of the\ncurrent state, is better than the alternatives; validating the pathway.  The\njustification is usually woven into the other three elements.\n5.11 Information Operations .  Information Operations  (Info Ops)  is a staff function to \nanalyse, plan, integrate and assess information activities to create desired effects on the will, \nunderstanding and capability of adversaries, potential adversaries and audiences in support \nof mission objectives.  Info Ops staff turn the STRATCOM direction into actionable plans , in \nthe form of Information Activities , and as such provide input into the J3 and J5 staff \nbranches.  Information Activities only take place within the  Joint Operations Area (JOA)  and \nare delivered by military forces . Info Ops has  six functions:  \n• Information environment assessment.\n• Information operations planning.\n• Information activities synchronization and integration.\n• Engagement.\n• Contribution to joint targeting.\n• Counter -hostile information activities.\n2 AJP 10.1 Information Operations page Lex -10. \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 4 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 5.12 Information Operations Principles .  Info Ops is based on certain principles that \nshape its role within the planning and joint targeting processes  and thus directs the way in \nwhich information activities support the execution and achievement of objectives across the \nfull range of campaign themes.   \n• Comprehensive understanding .   The foundation for Info Ops is derived\nfrom understanding the commander’s objectives, guidance and intent, the \nSTRATCOM direction and guidance and a comprehensive understanding of the \ninformation environment, the audiences that inhabit it and how information impacts \nthem in the operating environment.  \n• Narrative -led.  Actions, images and words, derived from the narrative, must\nbe coherent with one another at all levels – strategic, operational and tactical.\n• Effects focused .  Info Ops planners must identify the effects required to\nachieve objectives and then, through their understanding of the information\nenvironment, select the appropriate activity or combination of activities to create\nthose effect s.  These activities  are delivered by Psychological and Media\nOperations  working with and through elements of the joint force .\n• Integrated .  All activities will have a resultant cognitive effect and Info Ops\nstaff must be integrated throughout the planning and targeting process to recognize\nand explain the behavioural change from activities.\n• Agility .  Info Ops staff must be agile and responsive to a continually evolving\ninformation environment.  They must persistently monitor, assess and evaluate\neffects in the operating environment to allow rapid adjustment to be made when\nrequired.\n• Centrali sed planning and decentrali sed execution .  Due to the\nrequirement to fully integrate the Info Ops staff, the principles of centrali sed\nplanning and decentrali sed execution apply at all levels of command.  Therefore,\ncommanders should be prepared to accept risk and delegate authority to the lowest\npractical level .\n• Assessment .   A key part of Info Ops is an effective assessment of the short\nand long -term effects of activities, directed towards objectives.  It is recognized that\nbehavioural change is not usually immediate.  Attention is focused on indicators of\ndesired change or desired sustainment of an audience’s behaviour, such as political\nactivity and expressions of unrest, or changes in the perception or attitude of the\ncivilian population.\nThere are a number of additional capabilities and techniques which may be integrated as  \npart of  information activities  – these may include: Cybersp ace operations, EW, CIMIC, \nphysical destruction, OPSEC, deception and presence, posture and profile.  \n5.13 Info Ops  Planning  - Analyse .  The Info Ops staff provide the commander with an \nanalysis and assessment of the information environment as part of the comprehensive \nunderstanding of the operational environment (CUOE) . This analysis and assessment in \nconducted in a number of ways:  \na. Information Environment .   The Information Environment is made up of 3\nDimensions .  These dimensions are further segmented into seven layers  as shown in\nFigure 5.3.\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 5 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25  \n(1) Information Dimensions .   There are three dimensions: the cognitive\ndimension where the brain gathers and processes information; the virtual\ndimension is how we communicate and the physical dimension is the real\nworld where nation states, cultures and societies interact.\n(2) Information Inter -Relationships .   The interconnected nature of the\ndimensions and their respective layers allow  identification of  potential targets\nand the interrelated aspects of the information environment.\n(3) Characteristics of the Modern Information Environment .\n• Borderless .   The information environment is essentially\nborderless.  Information can move around the world in seconds and in\nan almost unrestricted manner.\n• Alternative Voices .   The information environment has many\nalternative voices.  The public are able to comment on almost any\nissue via the medium of social media with little or no editorial control.\n• Competing Messages .   With many alternative voices, come\nmany competing messages.  These will both support or oppose many\ndifferent issues.\n• Barriers to Entry .   The ability to operate in the information\nenvironment is relatively inexpensive.  Anyone with a smartphone and\naccess to data would be able to contribute.\nb. Information Environment Analysis (IEA) .   The Info Ops staff conduct IEA\non behalf of the commander.  It compliments JIPOE, and like it, is a process that\nFigure 5.3: The Information Environment  \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 6 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 requires continuous updating as the situation develops. IEA  consist of 5 areas of \nanalysis: Baseline, Human Factors, Communications, Audience and B ehaviour.   \nThese are illustrated in Figure 5.4 below and AJP 10.1 Chapter 4 has more detail.  \n(1) Baseline Analysis .   The baseline analysis is the foundation of\nunderstanding for an operation.  It is informed by J2 assessments but much of\nthe contents of this analysis can be found via open sources.\n(2) Human Factor Analysis .   A summary of the key deductions of the\nhuman factors analysis is often displayed using the PMESII/ASCOPE analysis\ntool as can be found at Serial 3-01-06.\n(3) Communications A nalysis .   The communications – messaging – of\nall actors within a crisis inform s the IEA.  This requires analysis of narratives\n(both friendly and adversary), analysis of adversary messages, own\nmessages and other key actors.\n(4) Audience Analysis .   An Audience is defined as, ‘an individual, group\nor entity whose interpretation of events and subsequent behaviour may affect\nthe attainment of the end state.’  To understand and effect changes in an\naudience’s attitudes and behaviours, it requires an understanding of\naudiences to identify those who can influence the end state and their current \nactivities, perceptions and behaviours . Audiences are  part of 3 main \ncategories: Public, Stakeholder or Actor.  A shade shift diagram can be \nconstructed to ‘segment’  identified audiences and to determine which \npotential cognitive effects could be applied to these audiences  to achieve the \nend state.   From this potential target audiences can be developed, which are \nthose which activities can be directed to create desired effects.   Audiences \nand their analysis, and the shade shift are at Serial 1 -02-01.   \n(5) Behaviour Analysis .   Behaviour analysis seeks to identify the\nbehavioural vulnerabilities and opportunities of an approved target audience\nto support the planning of activities.   AJP 10.1 lists several approaches in\nChapter 4.\nFigure 5.4: Information Environment  Analysis  \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 5.14 Info Ops  Planning  - Plan .   Info Ops staff must have a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the HQ operations planning process so that they are able to contribute to it \nat every stage.  As shown in Figure 5.5 below.   \n \n• Initiation .   The IEA starts during initiation.    \n• Mission Analysis .  Develop further the IEA and integrate with the JIPOE. \nConduct f actor, narrative and CoG analys is. Develop shade shift, possible effects \nand target audiences to be agreed . \n• COA Development .   Develop effects and assessment criteria for COAs.  \nPropose Info Ops targets to the targeting board.  \n• COA Analysis .   Refine the Info Ops input to each COA and support \nwargaming.  \n• COA Validation and Comparison .   Use behavioural analysis to support \nevaluation of COAs.  \n• Comd’s Decision .   Provide Info Ops input into CONOPs for each COA.  \n• Plan Development .   Provide IEA and Info Ops appendices to OPLAN.    \n \n  \n5.15 Info Ops  Planning  - Integrate .   Info Ops coordinat e and integrate the STRATCOM \ndirection and guidance horizontally within headquarters.  The primary purpose is creating \ncognitive effects, or more broadly supporting activities that are designed for physical and or \nvirtual effect and have an informational el ement to them.  As such Info Ops staff must be \nfully integrated into the headquarters battle rhythm attending the correct working groups and \nboards.

Information Activities Working Group  (IAWG) .   A separate IAWG may be\nconvened or this activity may form part of the Joint Target ing Coordination Board\n(JTCB).  Irrespective of where it sits , it must ensure that information activities are\ncoherent and synchronised across the headquarters .\nb. Joint Targeting .   Info Ops staff will develop target materials for information\nactivities, which will be validated, approved and prioriti sed through the joint targeting\nprocess for resource allocation and effects employment.\nc. Execution .   Info Ops targets will be delivered  by either PsyOps or Media\nOps working with and through elements of the joint force.\n5.16 Info Ops  Planning  - Assess .   Assessment seeks to analyse and report on the \nperformance and effectiveness of information activities to provide feedback to decision -\nmakers so that information activities can be modified where necessary to achieve the \ndesired results. Because there is alw ays a delay between cause and effect of information \nactivities, assessment is not immediate. Access to audiences being affected is not always \npossible but Info Ops staff should identify indicators and warnings for information activities to \npredict and obse rve behavioural changes over time.   MOPs and MOEs can be developed for \ninformation activities as for the rest of the joint actions and can be reported via the \nheadquarters assessment process , the Assessment WG and the Assessment Board .  \n5.17 Psychological Operations .    Psychological Operations or PsyOps are planned \nactivities using methods of communication and other means directed at approved audiences \nin order to influence perceptions, attitudes and behaviours, affecting the achievement of \npolitical and military ob jectives.  The primary purpose of PsyOps is to influence approved \ntarget audiences to have a direct effect on both understanding and will, together with an \nindirect effect on capability.  Their key responsibilities are:  \na. Audience Analysis .   The PsyOps staff provides audience research and\ntarget audience analysis to the IEA.\nb. Psychological Operations planning .   The PsyOps staff provides specialist\nPsyOps advice to the planning process.\nc. Counter -hostile information and disinformation .   The PsyOps staff\nsupports counter -hostile information and disinformation activities through their\ncontribution to the IEA function and coordination with the Info Ops staff.\nd. Web operations .   The PsyOps   staff can plan and execute focused digital\nengagement activities with approved audiences as part of a coordinated\ncommunications campaign as part of joint operations.\n5.18 Psychological Operations  Planning . \na. What effect is to be achieved and what behavioural change is sought?\nFor each target audience we must confirm what effects are to be achieved.  PsyOps\nplanners need to be precise in the meaning of the effects.  The current behaviour of\nthe target audience needs to be understood: what does this behaviour mean and\nwhat is the audience achieving by it?  The desired behaviour also must be described:\nwhat  behaviour do we want the target audience to exhibit after we have applied our\neffects?  These are developme nts of the a udience and actor analysis conducted by\nInfo Ops.\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 9 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 b. Who is the message directed at, who is the target audience?   PsyOps\nplanners take the identified audiences and analyse them further.  An\nASCOPE/PMESII -PT analysis is conducted on each audience.  The audience’s\nrelationships with other audiences on the shade shift should be examined for\nstrengths and weaknesses, e.g., h ow strong are a rebel group ties to the main enemy\nforce we are facing? PsyOps planners need to understand the target audience's\nvulnerabilities, what freedoms do they have, how are they constrained, what cultural\nconsiderations about the audience do we ha ve to consider – which aspects can we\nuse when we start to design our messages, and which should we avoid?\nc. When is the effect to be delivered and for how long?   The Joint or\nComponent synchronisation matrices will determine when effects are to be delivered.\nPsyOps planners have to take this general direction and add detail to it and plan\nwhen actions and activity will occur.  The time dimension is critical to success in\nPsyOps.  Every PsyOps  product is tailored to the audience.  Products take time to\ndesign and develop, to test and evaluate.  The products then need to be delivered to\nthe audience and the message understood.  And time needs to be given for the\nnece ssary behaviour change to occur.\nd. What is the mess age and who will deliver the message?  In terms of\ndeveloping the Message, PsyOps planners will take the themes and high -level\nmessages and adapt these for the target audience based on the required effects and\nbehaviour changes sought, the target audience analysis and the timing.  The key skill\nthat the PsyOps planners bring is the ability to identify what are known as lines of\npersuasion in developing messages.  Effectively there are six lines of persuasion:\n(1) Reciprocity.   Simply put, people are obliged to give back to others\nthe form of a behaviour, gift, or service that they have received first.  So, the\nkey to using the Principle of Reciprocity is to be the first to give and to ensure\nthat what you give is personalised and unexpected.  This principle works well\nin one -on-one communication situations like key leader engagement.\n(2) Scarcity .   In many operations, the fabric of society and normal life\nhas broken down.  Simple everyday processes can almost stop. For example;\nchildren going to school; being able to walk safely in the street or go to the\nmarket.  People want more of those rare o r scarce but normal things which\nare in short supply.  In using this idea, you must point out what is unique\nabout your proposition and what they stand to lose if they fail to consider your\nproposal.  Messages can use this technique to demonstrate that these routine\nactivities can be restored ie going to market can be part of normal life again.\nThe trick is not to over promise or guarantee. “Under Promise Over Deliver” \n(UPOD).  \n(3) Authority .   This is the idea that people follow the lead of credible,\nknowledgeable experts.  This is important in selecting messengers – use\nsomeone the audience you are messaging can identify with and who has\nauthority about the message.  For example, if you are mes saging about a\nmedical issue use a medical person to do it.\n(4) Consistency .  People like to be consistent with the things they have\npreviously said and done.  Messaging must be consistent over time when\naddressing audiences and not contradictory.\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 10 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 (5) Liking .   People prefer to say yes to those they like.  People like\npeople who are similar to them, who pay compliments and who cooperate\nwith them.  This can be effective if employed by those elements of the force\nwho work amongst people, to bring the people ov er to support the joint force.\nThe other side is also true, if we do not pay compliments and do not\ncooperate with people, it is much harder to succeed.\n(6) Consensus.   When they are uncertain, people will look to the actions\nand behaviours of others to determine their own.  In messaging to audiences,\nshow what others have done and what the benefits have been.\ne. How do we get the message to the audience – which channel or\nchannels to use ?   In the ASCOPE -PMESII -PT analysis you will have identified what\nmeans exist to communicate with audiences.  If they exist, then joint forces should\nseek to use them.  Some may have to be put in place.  It is likely that the message\nwill have to use more  the one channel.  So, for example, you may have to deliver a\nmessage through radio, leaflets, and word of mouth.\nf. Legal .   Finally, as messaging products are developed whether they be for\nradio or TV broadcast, online or printed they all must be cleared by a legal officer.\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 MEDIA OPERATIONS  \nThis summary is taken from AJP -10.3 (Ed A) Ver 1 Sep 2024 Doctrine for Military Public \nAffairs . (known in NATO as Military Public Affairs or Mil PA  but at MAJCSC known as Media \nOperations ).    \n6.1 The Media .   The word media is a collective noun which refers to a means of mass \ncommunication.  This covers what is known as traditional media – newspapers, television, \nradio - often referred to in English as the ‘press’ and digital media – websites, social media, \nblogs etc.    \n6.\n2 Media Operations.   Media Operations is the strategic communications \n(STRATCOM ) capability responsible for promoting military aims and objectives by \ncommunicating accurate and truthful information to internal and external audiences in a \ntimely manner.  \n6.\n3 Media Operations Principles .  Media Ops staff need to be aware of the key Media \nOps principles : \na. C\nonduct truthful narrative- led communication.    All Media Ops  efforts\nsupport commanders and staff in the execution of their mission.   Media Ops staff\ndevelop and promulgate compelling narratives that support the military aims  and\nobj\nectives in line with the commander’s priorities and in respect of the STRATCOM\nguidance.\nb. P\nrovide accurate information in a timely manner .   This is critical to\nfunctional and organisational credibility and trust with publics, internal audiences  and\nt\nhe media, and helps deter adversary disinformation.  The impact of Media Ops\nactivity is often directly proportional to the timeliness and accuracy of the Media Ops\neffort or response: information delivered quickly can have a qualitatively  different\neffect than the same information delivered a day or even an hour later.   However,\naccuracy should not be traded for speed – once official information has be en\npubl\nished it cannot be taken back.\nc. E\nnsure that information is consistent, coordinated and integrated wit h\na hi\ngher HQ .   Communication is a collective and integrated effort. Words and\nac\ntions must be aligned, and commanders ensure that their media operations provide\na consistent message, and that military information activities are well coordinated.\nd. P\nractise appropriate operations and personnel security .   OPSEC  and\nper\nsonnel security  provisions must be considered and adhered to before informati on\ni\ns released.   Protecting commanders/headquarters  against criticism or\nembarrassment is not a reason to classify or withhold information about th e\nunder\nlying issues. In general, the principle of ‘no surprise’ for higher HQ  applies.\ne. C\nonduct work with an understanding of the human environment and\nmindful of multinational sensitivities .   It is critical that the information environment\nand human environment are understood wherever operations are  conduct ed.\nOper\nations can be adversely affected by unconscious biases or culturally\ninappropriate references or imagery .  These can be prevented through applying a n\nappr\noach that includes, e.g., proper cultural, political and other analyses. Conversely\nthe effect and impact of communications is made stronger when they are informed by\nan understanding and appreciation of local custom, tradition and culture.\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.4 Roles and Responsibilities  of Media Operations at the Operational Level . \na. R\nole of the Commander.  The Commander of the JTF (JTFC) is ultimately\nresponsible for the success of the operation.  A positive public perception of t he\nC\nommander is critical to the success of the communications strategy.  The\nCommander needs to decide at an early stage the broad level of visibility  and\nex\nposure to the media he personally wishes to have.  This will determine how  he\nwis\nhes to use his Media Ops staff.  Although the Media Ops staff will cover t he\nac\ntivity of the entire force, they will always retain a direct line to the Commander, w ho\nby\n definition becomes the principal spokesman for the force.\nb. Role of Staff .  The principal role of the Media Ops staff is to achiev e\nc\nommunications effect through the delivery of messages.  Specifically, they are\nrequired to conduct a range of tasks, principally to:\n•Keep the JTFC abreast of media activity.\n•Advise the JTFC on the  alignment of  media activity to themes and\nmessages being pursued at the strategic level.\n•Assist the JTFC in his direct dealings with the media (including t he\npr\novision of a spokesman).\n•Plan, coordinate and implement facilities for media assignments.\n•Provide talking points/media lines to take in support of key information\nobjectives.\n•Handle the media aspects of serious incidents, including briefi ng and\nr\nebuttal if delegated to do so by the chain of command.\n•Provide direction to Component Commanders/subordinates and theirMedia Ops staffs.\n•Ensure press releases issued within the JOA/AO do not provideinformation of value to the enemy.\n•Implement the Operational Security (OPSEC) plan up, down and acrossall levels of media contact.\n•Conduct appropriate media monitoring and analysis.\nc. Key Media Ops Staff .  There are some key members of the Media Ops staff,\nwho will be central to delivering media ops effects:\n1. Chief Media Operations.   The Chief Media Ops is the JTFC’s\nprincipal Media Ops staff officer.  He is responsible for providing advice on the\nimplementation of STRATCOM  direction from the JTFC  and for Media Ops\nplanning and briefing.  He will have personal and regular access to JTFC.\n2. S\npokesman.   The spokesman will be the ‘face’ of the JTF to the\nmedia and will speak most often to them.  He should be carefully selected for\nhis skills in not just presentation but also in his ability to understand the wider\npolitical and legal dimensions of the JTF mission.  It is likely he will  be\ns\nelected personally by the Commander and be trusted by him.\n3. M\nedia Adviser .   JTFC’s are usually provided with a MOD appointed\nsenior media adviser.  He would work closely with the Media Ops staff an d\npr\novide that link to the Commander from the operational to the strategic level.\nHe would work closely with the Policy Adviser (POLAD) to do this.\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.5 Joint Media Operations Capabilities .   The main Media Ops capabilities are \nexplained below.  In addition to these, Media Ops will provide escorts to assist the media in \ngetting out, if the situation permits, to gather information for their reports.  \na. A Media  Information Centre ( MIC).   The MIC is the ‘Operational Media\nCentre’, that is responsible for the day -to-day contact between the JTFHQ and the\nmedia.  As such, the M IC is an area away from the main JTFHQ, it has no access to\nclassified material or direct access to key JTFHQ personnel.  However, the M IC mus t\nbe r\nun in such a way as to be welcoming to the media and be the source of\ninformation to the media.  It should provide facilities such as power and broadband,\nso the media can file their stories.\nb. M\nedia Production Team (MPT) .   The MPT works with the MIC to provi de\ni\nmagery, video and other products for use by the media and internally by the JTFHQ.\nThe JTF will be the only source of some imagery and video from specific high threatTF areas.  This will be collected by a Combat Camera Team, where the media do not\nhave access.  The MPT will ensure this activity is captured and the products provi\nded\nt\no the media.  Any MPT product made available the media has to be provided in the\nright format and in sufficient copies to provide the media with access; this is oft en\ndone el\nectronically.\nc. M\nedia Operations Team  (MOT).   Media operations teams are deployed at\nthe JTF HQ level and act as the primary interface between the commander and t he\nm\nedia.   Teams provide a broad range of media capabilities to plan, coordinate and\ndeliver JTF media activities.\nd. A\n Combat Camera Team (CCT) Capability .   The JTF will deploy with a\nnumber of CCTs who will collect imagery to support the JTF information activities.This imagery may be made available to the media , JTF units, and members of the\ncoalition or for use by coalition government departments.\ne. M\nonitoring and Analysis Team .   The Monitoring and Analysis team analys e\nm\nedia comment and output about the operation.  They will cover media based both\ninside and outside the JOA .  It will provide summaries of what is being reported, how\nand why, which contribute to situational awareness.  To conduct its role fully it will\nemploy linguists to assess local media.  Monitoring and Analysis is not a J2 function,\nit may contribute information into the intelligence cycle but does not provide J 2\na\nssessments.\n6.6 B\nasic Functions of Media Operations . \na. M\nedia Ops  plans.    The Media O ps plans function aims at planning Media\nOps capability activities in accordance with higher HQ direction and guidance ,\nr\neceived through the STRATCOM  planning process; production of planning inputs to\nthe operations planning process and decision- making process, which involves\nworking group and board participation; issuing guidance to lower -level military Medi a\nO\nps; synchronisation and integration of its own plans with whole HQ plans (through\nthe Info Ops processes).\nb. Media activities .   Media activities are information activities conducted by\nMedia Ops  that enable communication with a wide variety of audiences thr ough\nengagem\nent with the media. Commanders and staffs, through media ops , are\npr\nepared to respond to media queries, issue statements, conduct briefings  and\ni\nnterviews, arrange for media access to permanent and operational units,  and\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 distribute information through the traditional media, as a means to develop relations \nwith the purveyors and consumers of news.  \nc. Media production .   The media production function supports the conduct of\ninternal and external communications and includes (but is not limited to) t he\npr\noduction of images, videos and written media ops  products (e.g., photos, liv e\nbr\noadcasts, posters, backgrounders, infographics).\nd. Digital media activities .   Digital media activities provide information directly\nto audiences through online and digital media channels.   Digital media must not\nsimply broadcast information, but foster engagement with all stakeholders involved,\nexisting supporters and broader potential audiences.\ne. Media monitoring and analysis .   Media monitoring and analysis provides\nearly warning and analysis of news, assesses the media environment to help prepare\ncommunications plans, and provides post- engagement feedback and evaluation.\nf. Internal communications.    Internal communications are a comm and\nr\nesponsibility and Media Ops  is the lead function responsible for supporting the chai n\nof\n command in executing it.  Internal communications inform the members of the JTF\nabout the command, its people and its activities, and are distinct from administrativ e\ni\nnformation.\n6.7 G\neneric planning model for  Media Operations .   The Media Ops staff will \ncontribute to the STRATCOM input into the joint estimate.  \n• Initiation .

A Press Release is issued when there is \nsomething newsworthy to communicate to the media; they are not issued for every activity \nthat occurs during an operation.  A Press Release is not just a product but a way of trying to \nachieve a specific communications objective or effect – you must decide on the effect to be \nachieved before writing the press release.  A well written press release serves not only as a source of information but also provides information to the media of operations and activities \nthat they may wish to cover in greater depth using their own resources.  Press releases \nshould:  \n•Arouse interest in the appropriate audience and appeal to them.  The use ofexaggeration for this purpose is not acceptable.\n•Each topic addressed in press releases should be placed in its proper context to t\nhe\ngr\neatest possible degree.\n•Be authorised and cleared by the chain of command before  being issued; especially\nif the subject is contentious or about a tragic incident.\n•Be sent to all media outlets, not just print media.\n•Be written in a manner that is readily understandable.  Technical terms shoul d be\nus\ned as little as possible and always be clarified.\n•Keep the main content of the Press Release on one page and the Background on t he\ns\necond page and no more.\n•Contain short sentences.\n•Accredit statements and directives by name or a military source, eg JTFC HQ Medi a\nCe\nll.\n•Not be classified, as Press Releases are distributed to the public/press.\n•Be Word Documents and not pdfs – the press will want to use the text and can’t\neasily cut and paste from a pdf.\n•Don’t u se dashes as internet searches don’t recognise dashes !\n•Must answer the following questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How and HowMuch – the 5Ws and 2Hs\n2:\nT\nhe 5Ws and 2Hs:  \nWHO?  •Full details of person or group spelled out: rank, first name(s), last\nname(s)\n•Full details of unit spelled out\nWHAT?  •Explain succinctly what happened/is being announced\n•Do not discuss exact numbers or troop strength (use descriptions\nlike ‘Light’, ‘Heavy’ or ‘Moderate’).\nWHEN?  •Day and month\n•You don’t need the calendar year if the event/announcement is i n\nthe same year\nWHERE?  •Exact location keeping in mind operational security issues if that is\na factor\nWHY?  •Explain the significance of the news event\n•If there are operational security considerations that precl ude\nreleasing this information, say so\nHOW?  •How did an incident happen?\n•If there are operational security considerations that precl ude\nreleasing this information, say so\n1 The word ‘Press’ is used in this context as a proper noun.

They assist the spokesman by keeping him \non track during an interview, press conference etc.  They should provide information about \nthe subject of the interview or press conference.  Talking Points should also provide the spokesman with links to the wider themes and messages appropriate to the time of the \ninterview or press conference.  They often incorporate sample questions and answers to \nfurther support the spokesman.  Spokesman may not be experienced Media Ops staff \nofficers in the JTFHQ, they may be officers or soldiers within units in the JTF.  Talking Points \nshould be written with this in mind. Note:  \n•Tal\nking Points are for internal use and are never to be released to the media  or\nplaced on an open- source web page.  If the spokesman is talking to the media on the\ntopic of a recently issued press release, then the talking points should reflect whatwas issued in the press release and provide further detail.\n•Often at the start of a press conference, the lead spokesman has an opportunity tomake a statement, this will usually last between 3 -5 minutes before taking questions.\nThe talking points provide the key information that the spokesman needs to getacross in the statement.  The questions and answers provided support the\nspokesman in the press questions that follow the statement.\n•Talking Points can be read as  a script if the spokesman is unfamiliar with the topic, or\nif accuracy id required such as talking about a specific incident.   They are a series of\nbullet points or short paragraphs that the spokesman can refer to.  In a pressconference the spokesman may cover these in the order they are presented duri\nng\nhi\ns opening statement.  In an interview with a journalist, he may not get questions on\ntopics in the order they appear in the talking points.  This doesn’t matter as long asthe spokesman has the points to refer to, he can bring them into the conversation at\nthe appropriate time.\n•Further Guidance:\n•Talking Points should be clear and concise.\n•Use plain English and short sentences.•Background is used now instead of Notes for\nEditors\n•If used, this may be background material to the\nstory  \n•Links to key information sources about the storyare included\n•Always put contact details\n•The press can use these to follow up on the storyand confirm details\n•This does not have to be a named person\nAgain, put the published date at the bottom of the \npress release  ENDS signifies the end of the Press Release text  \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Must be factual and accurate.\n•Avoid technical terms or jargon.\n•Avoid humour – Talking Points might be used by more than one person or\nquoted\n•Put your key point as the first point; if there has been a Press Release on t he\nt\nopic reflect the lead point in the Press Release in your Talking Points.\n•Support your main point with further information, explanation or an example.\n•Address the specific topic but include wider messages and themes that ar e\nappr\nopriate.\n•Anticipate what the press will ask and incorporate this in your questions a nd\nans\nwer section.\n•Talking Points for good news will not take as long to write as talking points for\nsomething bad or controversial.\n•If writing Talking Points on a bad or controversial topic, be up front about it – it\nshould be your first point.  Think carefully about the questions and answers to\nsupport the spokesman appropriately.\n•Remember people think in three’s.\n6.10 Preparing for a Press Conference.  Use the following points as an aide memoire \nfor organising and conducting at press conference.  Remember that any information release to the press – information packs, videos, pictures etc must be cleared first and authorised for \nrelease:  \n• Is a press conference the most appropriate and effective way to deliver\nthe message? Is this announcement or occurrence of important news value?\n• Obtain appropriate approvals. The press conference should not come as\n a\ns\nurprise to the chain of command.\n• Consider national and international linkages and issues . Local issues\nmay have something in common with regional, national, and international issues.\n• Select the proper spokesman (men) . The principal spokesman should b e\nt\nhe most qualified and knowledgeable person available. The spokesman shoul d be\nt\nhoroughly briefed using relevant talking points and Q&As and a rehearsal\nconducted.  Likewise prepare appropriate Subject Matter Experts if they are to speak.• Select the proper venue. Choose a location large enough to accommodat\ne\nt\nhe numbers of journalists that are expected.  Confirm adequate electrical power is\navailable to accommodate television lights and that an internet connection, VTC\nand/or satellite connection are available as  required.  Make sure the location is easily\naccessible, and that media representatives do not have to carry heavy equipment\nlong distances.  Be sure the room is well- ventilated in summer and well heated i n\nwin\nter.\n• Send out invitations .  Send out a Media Advisory inviting the press to the\npress conference, about four or five days before the press conference, unless  a\npr\ness conference is called at short notice following an incident or because of\nbreaking news.  Follow up the day before w ith an email to media, editors, or news\ndirectors.  A fter the event, post a copy of the information pack you prepared for t he\nev\nent online for those in the media who could not attend.   This demonstrates interest\non your part, and it may help you get a better turnout at future press conferences.\n• Prepare information packs and hand -outs carefully.  Information packs\nare valuable aids because they allow the officer conducting the press conference t o\nr\nefer to the pack for technical questions or statistical details.  The person giving t he\nnew\ns conference must be completely familiar with the contents of the pack, since\ncredibility can suffer if that person mistakenly refers to information not included in t he\npac\nk.  Distribute the information packs before the press  conference starts.\n• Have a moderator . The moderator is the first person who will speak to the\npress at the conference.  He introduces the press conference, explains the gr ound\nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 9 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 rules, and he introduces the spokesman.  He may coordinate the questions from the \npress or this may fall to a press conference chairman.  He must speak to the \nspokesman before the press conference to confirm the key messages and conduct a \nrehearsal.  The r oles of the press conference moderator are at below.  \n• Select visual aids and products carefully . If visual aids are used to support \na press conference you must make those videos/pictures available to the press.  \nBecause of its access, the military can often provide videos and pictures that the \nmedia cannot get themselves.  Make sure the press repres entatives know from the \noutset which visual products will be available.  For example, television reporters will \nexpect copies of video recordings, and print journalists will want photographs, copies \nof charts, stati stics and overheads.  If copies are not immediately available, you \nshould say so, but be prepared to provide them later.  \n• Press Conference Layout -  Accommodate all media . Within Media Ops \nthere will be a team that set up and layout each press conference.  There will be standard layout which should be used –  see layout diagram below.  Television \nreporters are the most challenging to accommodate.  From a visual perspective,  the \ntable or lectern for the spokesperson participating in the press conference should be the focus of the event, at the front of the room, ideally on a slightly raised platform.  \nThere should be a large cent ral aisle to permit camera operators to shoot straight on.  \nAlternatively, you should provide cameramen a raised platform at the back of the room to permit filming over the heads of other participants and media \nrepresentatives.  In an outdoor setting, you can mark off a semicircle facing the spokesperson, to allow the press conference participants and the media \nrepresentatives to arrange themselves according to their requirements.  Television \nreporters usually want to maintain eye contact with their camera operators, and radio \nreporters generally prefer to sit near the front of the room, so they can adjust sound levels. Generally speaking, print journalists can sit anywhere.  From a technical point \nof view, you should make sure that appropriate audio- feed facilities are available for \nall journalists who want to record the press conference.  \n• Anticipate Frequent Movement . There will be frequent movement during the \npress conference.  Movement is a feature of press conferences which is often \nunexpected by those taking part for the first time.  Radio reporters move about to \nchange or adjust recording device sound levels, tel evision -camera operators wander \naround looking for interesting angles, and photographers move back and forth to \nobtain a variety of pictures. Be prepared for movement, and brief the person giving \nthe press conference accordingly . \n• Time the Press Conference well .   The timing of the press conference will \ndepend on the key audiences you are attempting to reach and the news cycle where \nthose audiences live. If the intended audiences are western ones, then ideally, press \nconferences should take place between 10:00 and 11:30 am in western times zones.  \nThis allows members of the press to be allocated to the cover the press conference \nand to prepare.  It also allows media editors to feature the material from the press \nconference on noon newscasts and in afternoon and early -evening editions.  Press \nconferences in the afternoon run the risk of being overtaken by fast -breaking stories.  \nIn scheduling the date and time for the press conference, consider the competition \nfrom other scheduled events in the area.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025  \n \n \n \n \n \n6.\n11 Press Conference  Moderator’s Roles.  The press conference moderator will be the \nfirst person to speak at a press conference and as such is a key role.  He will only speak for \n2-3 minutes but what and how he speaks will set the tone for the rest of the press\nconference.  His preparation prior to the press conference will be key to success. The\nm\noderator needs to gain the confidence of the room and ensure the press know what is\ngoing to happen, how it will happen, who will be speaking to them and how long they havegot.

The Spokesman (men) will be the focal point of any press \nconference.  Commanders at all levels should expect to be spokesman at some point and \nshould seize the opportunity to communicate with the press.  For routine matters, a military \ncommand may have a designated spokesman, whose primary role is to talk to the press.    \n6.13 Preparing the Spokesman Pre -Interview/Press Conference .  A member of the \nmedia ops team should meet with the spokesman prior to the interview/press conference:  \n• Explain the role of media ops.  \n• Explain the purpose of the interview/press conference.  \n• Cover attendees.  \n• Cover the location of the interview/press conference.  \n• Review ground rules.  \n• Time limits.  \n• Review talking points and Q+A.  \n• Who are the key audiences? \n• The moderator should also speak to the spokesman and go through the \nrunning order of the press conference  \n• Rehearse!  \n6.14 Spokesman Presence, Focus and Clarity. Consider and do the following:  \n \n• Presence:  \no Sound confident.  \no Exhibit confidence; don’t be nervous.  \no Speak clearly.  \no Look at the interviewer.  \no Be open and relaxed.  \no Be lively but remember the emotion of the day –  if the press \nconference is covering bad news.  \no Be interesting.  \no Be friendly.  \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 13 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Focus:\noNo sunglasses or headwear.\noListen carefully and attentively.\noLook at the reporter who asks the question.\noIn reply , use their first name.\n•Clarity:\noKeep it simple.\noAssume your audience knows little about the armed forces.\nExplain necessary points and make analogies.\noAvoid jargon, acronyms and bureaucratic/pretentious\nlanguage.\noYou’re not briefing your boss; explain it like you would to yourfamily.\noNo profanity/swearing.\n6.15 Spokesman Do’s and Don’ts:  \n•Do\n’s:\noBe polite but firm.\noUse the reporter’s first name instead of ‘Sir’ or ‘Ma’am’.\noRespond to hard questions with ‘bad news’ as willingly as you\ndo good news to establish credibility and a good relationship.\noTake your time: formulate the answer in your mind befor e\ns\npeaking.\noBe brief & concise – 10-20 second responses are the rule of\nthumb.\noIgnore the camera and talk to the interviewer.\noRemain in control of the interview.\noReasoned responses will help you stay in control even if the\nquestions are silly or aggressive.\noAlways think OPSEC.\noStay in YOUR LANE – only talk about matters within your\nresponsibility or personal knowledge.\noIf you don’t know, say so.\noDon’t make anything up or speculate.\noIf you can’t talk about something, tell the media why.\noBe careful of statements of absolute nature.\n•Don’ts:\noDo not attempt to cover negative events with a cloak ofsecurity or secrecy.\noRefer requests for details about serious incidents to higherHQs.\noDon’t offer ‘off the record’ information.\noNever lie – you represent NATO and your unit.\noDo not discuss exact numbers or troop strength (us\ne\ndes\ncriptions like ‘Light’, ‘Heavy’ or ‘Moderate’).\noDo not discuss political or foreign policy matters – you don’t\nspeak for the politicians.\noDon’t give the enemy propaganda.\noResist grumbling or thoughtlessly complaining.\noDon’t forget the enemy watches TV.\noDon’t get trapped.\noIf a reporter claims they have information from a higher HQ,refer them back to that HQ for clarification.\nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 14 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 o Don’t try to answer something OUTSIDE your lane!  \n6.16 Interview Techniques.  Spokesmen must always remember the main messages \nand themes and try to work them into their answers by ‘bridging’ from the specific answer to \nthe broader message.  They should think of ‘soundbites’ –  short phrases which summarise \nthe key message.  \n \n• Bridging .   Bridging allows the spokesman to turn the question to his agenda.  \nSpokesman need to present their message and then support it.  If asked about a \nproblem – present a solution.  \no How?  Answer the question briefly or block the question (see blocking below).   \n‘Bridge’ to your key message by using a transitional phrase:  \no A: “what I can tell you”  “what you should consider”  “what’s important to \nrealise”  \n• Blocking.   Allows the spokesman to avoid the question.  Never say no comment and only block when there is good reason to do so.  If you cannot answer, say why, \nfor operational security reasons.  Then bridge to your key message.  \no How?  \nQ. Do you think the UN/Gold Alliance should authorise an attack?  \nA: “That’s a question for our political leadership [BLOCK]; what I tell you is \n[BRIDGE] that soldiers under my command are trained and ready to perform \nany mission they are called on to do [KEY MESSAGE].”  \n6.17 A Guide to Radio Interviews:  \n• Describe.  Radio listeners can’t see you so try to describe what it is you are \ntalking about –  paint a picture.  \n• Detail .  As you are trying to paint a picture, more detail is required than with a \nTV interview.  \n• Use your voice.  Be enthusiastic and use different tones of your voice to add \nto the atmosphere of the interview.  \n• Notes.  Write down any key points but do not use a script or have pre-\nprepared sentences.  They will sound unnatural.  \n• Don’t fiddle.  External noise can be distracting especially when there are no \nvisuals.  \n• Sound effects.  The  interviewer may wish to record background sounds.  \n6.18 Analysing a Press Conference and Conducting a n After -Action Review  \n• Role .  The media ops monitoring and analysis staff officers are responsible \nfor analysing any media activity, assessing its subsequent impact and recommending \nwhat, if anything, needs to happen in response to the media.  In order to do this \nanalysis staff officers  need to be involved at every stage of the interview/press \nconference.  They need to have all the relevant paperwork and be present during the preparation and rehearsal stages of the interview/press conference.

Media Ops analysis staff attend th e\ni\nnterview/press conference to monitor what questions were asked and what answers\nwere given in response.   These can be recorded electronically.  The mood of theinterview/press conference must be judged, as should how the responses t\no\nques\ntions were received.\n• After Action Review .   The Media Ops analysis staff conduct the after -action\nr\neview.  The staff may need a period of time to analyse the recording of t he\ni\nnterview/press conference to get the full benefit from the process.  The after -action\nr\neview should be run as a focussed discussion and draw on the experience of all w ho\nat\ntended the interview/press conference.

Introduction .  Surprise and security are two of the ten principles of war OPSEC and \ndeception support these principles .  It is critical that OPSEC and deception planning is taken \ninto account from the outset of the planning process at the strategic, operational and tactical \nlevels  of command.  \nOperations Security (OPSEC ).  \n7.2. OPSEC Definition.  OPSEC is defined as: ‘ the process that gives a military \noperation or exercise appropriate security, using passive or active means, to deny an \nadversary knowledge of the essential elements of friendly information, or indicators of them’ .  \n(AJP-3.10.2)  \n7.3. OPSEC Aim.  The aim of OPSEC is to deny critical information and indicators to \nadversaries.  \n7.4. Essential element of friendly information (EEFI) .  An EEFI is defined as: ‘ critical \ninformation about intentions, requirements, capabilities and vulnerabilities that, if compromised, could threaten the success of operations .’   \n7.5. OPSEC  Security Process.   OPSEC is more than a collection of specific rules and \ninstructions.  As a cyclical process, it should be applied to any operation or activity to deny \nEEFI to adversaries.  It is conducted in a five -step process that is continuous across all \nphases of operations, including post conflict.  It is not linear but is a continuous cycle, as \nillustrated in Figure 7 .1, and outlined below, with the need to continually identify EEFI and \nindicators as the central requirement . \n1\n.I\ndentify EEFI and indicators.  The\nOPSEC process must establish the context\nof the risk. The OPSEC staff must ensur e\nt\nhat EEFI and indicators specific to the plan,\noperation or activity are captured from th e\nr\nelevant staff.\n2.R\nisk assessment .  OPSEC assessment s\nar\ne the responsibility of OPSEC- trained staff,\nalthough they will require supporti ng\ni\nnformation from other staff.  The OPSEC\nstaff must work closely with the intelligenc e\ns\ntaff to identify the risk, analyse the risk  and\nev\naluate the risk .\n3:  Apply OPSEC measures. Once the \ncommander has selected the COA, the OPSEC \nstaff should identify the relevant OPSEC \nmeasures required to treat risks and finalize the plan to enforce them. \n4:  Monitor and review effectiveness of OPSEC measures. The OPSEC staff must \nevaluate the risk treatment provided by the OPSEC process. This should be a planned \npart of the process and must allow for continuous monitoring and review.  \n5:  Communicate and consult at all stages. The OPSEC staff must ensure the \nvalidated EEFI list is promulgated to all staff.  Communication and consultation with \ncommanders and staff should take place during all stages of the OPSEC process. OPSEC must be coordinated with all staff branches to ensure feedback on the \neffectiveness of OPSEC and be executed across the joint force.  \nFigure 7.1   The OPSEC Process  \nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 7.6. OPSEC Measures.  The following table of OPSEC measures is a guide only.   \nDevelopment of specific OPSEC measures is as varied as the specific vulnerabilities they \noffset.   Measures can be broken down into operations and logistics measures, technical \nmeasures and administrative measures . \nOperations & Logistics \nMeasures  Technical Measures  Administrative Measures \nRandomize the performance of \nfunctions and execution of \nmissions. Avoid repetitive or stereotyped tactics, techniques and procedures for executing \noperations.  Improve resilience to \ncyberattacks, implementing appropriate risk mitigation measures based on the results of cyber intelligence  Limit unsecure telephone \ncommunications . \nA\nvoid routine notices that \nreveal timings for events . \nEmploy force dispositions and \ncommand and control arrangements that conceal the \nlocation, identity and command \nrelationships of major units.  Prepare for electronic attack by \nensuring that appropriate electronic protective measures are in place.  Ensure that personnel are \naware of OPSEC vulnerabilities presented by \nonline social networking and \nuse of smartphones and other smart devices when  posting \ninformation about changes in personal or unit routines that \ncould indicate operations \nplanning or other details . \nConduct support activities in a \nway that will not reveal intensification of preparations before initiating operations.  Limit unsecure email \nmessages to non- military \nactivities and do not provide operational information.  Conceal budgetary \ntransactions,  supply requests \nand arrangements for services that reveal preparations for activity  \nTransport supplies and \npersonnel to combat units in a way that conceals the location and identity of the combat units.  Use encryption to protect \nvoice, data and video communications  Conceal the issue of orders, \nthe movement of specially qualified personnel to units, and the installation of special capabilities  \nOperate aircraft at low altitude \nto avoid radar detection  Maximize terrain masking  Control waste disposal or other \nhousekeeping functions  \nMinimize the reflective \nsurfaces that units or weapon \nsystems present to radars and \nsonars  Use screen jamming, \ncamouflage, smoke, \nbackground noise, added \nsources of heat or light, paint or weather conditions to mask activity  Follow normal leave and \nadministrative patterns to the \nmaximum extent possible prior \nto starting operations  \nDuring hostilities, use physical \ndestruction and electronic \nattack against the adversary’s \nability to collect and process information.  Deactivation of flight tracking \ndevices in the air domain and \nautomatic identification \nsystems in the maritime domain.  Ensure that personnel \ndiscreetly prepare for their families’ welfare. \nUse darkness to mask \ndeployments or force generation  OPSEC training provided to all \npersonnel involved in the operation or activity  \nProvide family OPSEC briefs to \ninform family members of the need for OPSEC.  \nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Deception  \n7.7. Overview .  Although OPSEC and deception are mutually supportive they are \nseparate  processes.   Deception at the operational level misleads an adversary about the \njoint task force commander’s (J TFC’s) conduct of operations in their joint operations area, to \npreserve freedom of action within the medium to short term .   \n• Deception explicitly targets the decision- maker critical to creating the requir ed\nbehav\nioural response.  The decision- maker may be at any level in any environment\nand may be indirectly targeted by influencing groups or sensors .\n• Operational -level deception may support a strategic deception plan.\n• Operational -level deception may require coordination with the strategic\nheadquarters and other government departments and may require approval of t he\ns\ntrategic commander.\n• Operational -level deception will also direct deception plans down to the tactical\nlevel and the component commanders, as tactical action can have strategic effects\nand consequences .\n• Deception is planned centrally;  it maintains operations security (OPSEC) a nd\nc\nontinuity from the strategic to the tactical level. It should unfold logically  and\nr\nealistically, feeding the adversary with the combat indicators they would expect to\nsee, yet not so obviously as to raise sus picion.\n• Adversarial intelligence must have enough time to collect and interpret fals e\ni\nnformation, but not sufficient time to conduct too thorough an analysis .\n7.8. Deception Definition.  Deception is: ‘deliberate measures to mislead targeted \ndecision-makers into behaving in a manner advantageous to the commander’s \nobjectives .’ (AJP-3.10.2)  \n7.9. Legal .  Provided it is not treacherous or otherwise prohibited by law or policy, \ndeception is a legitimate military activity and is a ruse of war. In an armed conflict, \ndeception must comply with the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) .  The use of deception \nmight be subject to other legal or policy limitations, including rules of engagement.  \n7.10.  Achieving a behavioural response . Deception is a psychological process and \nseeks a behavioural response, be it action or inaction. For the purposes of this SOHB Serial , \na behavioural response is a cognitive reaction to a stimulus that then provokes a decision to \nact or remain inactive.  \n7.11.  When can I  conduct deception?   Consider deception if favourable conditions for its \nsuccessful execution exist and it is likely to provide significant advantage.   These include:  \n• the adversary has an advantage that cannot be overcome without usi ng\ndec\neption – force strengths, capability, agility or situational awareness .\n• the adversary has known preconceptions that can be exploited .\n• the adversary has known flaws in their decision- making process .\n• the adversary is under pressure to act .\n• deception will enhance OPSEC .\n• deception will enhance the effectiveness of a conventional approach .\n• a target can only be influenced indirectly.\n7.12.  The Risk of Deception .  Deception should be considered a high -risk activity if: \n• Appropriate conditions to conduct deception do not exist;\n• The target has a record of detecting deception;\n• The understand process is incomplete or inconclusive – the target’s likely\nbehaviour in relation to the use of deception cannot be anticipated with any accuracy .\nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Insufficient knowledge exists of the adversary command and control  and\ni\nntelligence capability; and/or\n• The adversary becomes aware that they are being deceived then the plan may\nnot only fail but it could lead to adverse consequences by encouraging detailed re-\nevaluation of friendly forces COA.\n7.\n13. The Deception Process :  Deception is as much about thinking as it is about \nexecuting and needs to be a creative process. The six -step deception process below \noutlines the required approach to enable deception at the joint level . \n7.\n14. Structure of Deception.  The skeleton deception plan will outline four basic \nelements for each COA:  \n• Objective ; The J TFC’s planning guidance should provide deception goals and\nobj\nectives, which may be different for each COA.  The deception objective is a concis e\ns\ntatement of what the commander wishes the adversary to do, or not to do, and how it\nwill contribute to successful completion of the mission. This will provide the decepti on\npl\nanner with a clear aim. The objective is expressed as a positive result, such as\n‘deception will ensure the adversary does not commit its reserve due to the belief that\nthey are threatened fr om another flank/direction’. The target, story and plan are\nvariable and manipulated to form different approaches to achieve the objective.\n• Target ; The target decision- maker(s) identified during the understanding phas e\nbec\nomes the focus of the story and the plan.  This is because they can change the\nbehaviour of the adversary to meet the deception objective.  Knowledge of the target\ndecision- maker’s traits: speed of decision- making; clarity of information required befor e\ni\nssuing orders; willingness to accept risk; and which collection assets they most trust\nshould be taken into account as part of the target selection process.• Story;  Develop a story that will convince the target to behave in the desired way\nusing the deception techniques.   Seek to reduce the adversarial collecti\non and\nanal\nytical capability to detect the deception and thus reduce their chance of maki ng\nt\nhe true sense of what is happening.1•Commander's Initial Guidance\n•The Commander should articulate the deceptionintent in terms of the behavioural\noutcomes (what do you want the enemy to do?) providing a clear aim and focus forthe deception\n2•Understanding (The deception estimate)\n•Identify adversary decision makers and their predispositions (what values and beliefscan be exploited?)\n3•COA Development.\n•Each deception COA should have; the objective of the deception; the story; the target;and the plan. \n4•Commander's Selection of Deception COA\n•Development of deception plan; with a persuasive and believable story;  an\nas\nsessment plan; and  resource, coordination and synchronisation requirements.\n5•Commander's Approval of Deception Objectives.\n•Execute and monitor deception plan. Synchronise activity. Is the plan worki ng?\nD\noes the paln need to be modified? Do we need to terminate the plan?\n6•Assessment.\n•Was the behaviour objective achieved? Identify lesons and insights.\nFigure 7.2   The 6 Step Deception Process  \nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Plan.  The plan will detail the deception and the resources required to execut e\nand m\nonitor the adversary’s reaction to it.   Activities should be sequenced to maximiz e\nt\nhe portrayal of the deception story for the required period.  Identify the timelines\nrequired to deliver the activity, for the target to evaluate it and subsequently act upon\nit.  The time available for planning will affect what is  achievable.\n7.15.  Deception Planning .  The deception plan supports the operation plan (OPLAN). It is \nnested and integrated within the OPLAN to achieve coherence, yet it forms a separate  and \noften compartmentalized area of planning effort.  Deception planning happens parallel to all \nstages of the planning process. It contributes to the understanding generated in the initiation, it takes its direction from mission analysis and a skeleton deception plan supports COA \nanalysis, validation and comparison. After COA selection, the deception plan itself (the plan \nwithin the plan) is further developed.   Figure 7.3 illustrates this relationship . \n7.16.  Deception must be credible, consistent, verifiable, and executable . If a \ndeception plan is to be believable, the deception story must be:  \n• Credible in their minds - is it believable?\n• Consistent with the narrative of the operation and the strategic communications\nframework - does it make sense in the context with what is happening?\n• Verifiable by their collection assets in the time required - can it be confirmed?\n• Verifiable by friendly forces collection assets - can we confirm the opponent’s\nreaction?\n• Executable in terms of the actions that need to be conducted over the time\navailable to do so - can we do this in a timely manner?\n \nFigure 7.3   The Relationship between operations planning and the 6 Step Deception Process  \n\nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 7.\n17. Deception Techniques .  Consider the following deception techniques, to assist in \ndeveloping the deception plan. \n• The obvious solution . Reinforce the impression of taking an obvious or\nexpected approach to achieving the objective, whilst actually taking a different cours e\nof\n action (COA). This approach links with the false routine.\n• The false routine . Condition the target by repetition to believe you are pursui ng\nan appar\nently standard routine, whilst in fact preparing a quite different COA. This\napproach links with the obvious solution.\n• The substitution . Lead the target to believe nothing has changed by covertly\nsubstituting the false for the real, and vice versa.• The lure . Present the target with what appears to be a sudden or ideal\nopportunity they must exploit, whilst in fact luring them into a trap. This approach links\nwith the deliberate leak.\n• The deliberate leak. Deliberately disseminate information via agents, or other\nclandestine links, in such a way the target audience believes they have obtai\nned a\npi\nece of vital intelligence through skilful intelligence work. This approach links with t he\nl\nure.\n• The mistake . Lead the target to believe valuable information has come into their\npossession by mistake, through a breach of security, negligence or inefficiency. This\napproach links with the piece of bad luck.\n• The piece of bad luck. Convince the target they have acquired information of\nvital importance by accident, because of a train of circumstances over which friendly\nforces had no control. This approach links with the mistake.\n7.18.  Deception maxims. The following maxims also apply.  \n• Magruder’s principle .  It is generally easier to induce a deception target t o\nm\naintain a pre -existing belief than to deceive the deception target into changing that\nbelief.\n• Jones’ Dilemma .  Deception becomes more difficult as the number of sources\navailable to the deception target with which to confirm the real situation increases.\nHowever, the greater the number of sources that are deceptively manipulated, the\ngreater the chances the deception will be believed. Confirmation of the deceptiv e\ni\nnformation by a number of credible sources can help to reinforce the deception.\n• The inability to process small change in indicators over time. Decepti on\nt\nargets have proven vulnerable to not detecting small changes in essential elements of\nfriendly information (EEFI) and indicators, even if the cumulative change over time islarge.\n• Ambiguity enhancing or ambiguity reducing . Ambiguity enhancing decepti\non\nc\nauses the targeted decision- maker to become increasingly uncertain of the situation.\nAmbiguity reducing deception causes the targeted decision- maker to become certain,\ndecisive and yet wrong.\nSERIAL 4-03-01 \n4–03–01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2017  KLF ARMOURED VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS  \nSer Veh Weight \n(kg) MLC  Dimensions  (m) Maximum \nSustained \nRoad \nSpeed km /h Fuel \n(litres)  Range  (km) \nArmament  Ammo  Crew  Height  Length  Width  Road  Mixed  \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) (l) (m) (n) \n1.

Principally achieved by Land component indirect fire systems and GBAD, supported by ISTAR, and enabled by full spectrum targeting and battlespace management, OS will also orchestrate Jo int Fires from Army aviation assets and the Maritime and Air \ncomponents.\n \nROLES OF ARTILLERY:  \n4.2. Find.   ‘Find’ is critical to the core roles because without it there is little for the integrator  \nto be able to Strike and Integrate.  \n4.3. Strike .  The main aim in Strike is to destroy, cause attrition to or neutralise the  enemy \nutilising OS systems as part of t he combined arms or deep battle . \n4.4. Protect .  The requirement to protect the force embraces a number of specialised \ncapabilities within the Artillery supported by other assets.  \n4.5. Integrate.   The Targeting Process should be the main focus of activity to integrate \neffects across the full spectrum. The purpose of the Integrate role is to ensure that the \ncapabilities available to support ground manoeuvre are  coordinated and  de-conflicted to \nensure they support the plan and that the risks of  fratricide are reduced.

The best effect s are achieved a heavy concentration of fire from a number of assets at \nonce rather than fewer assets firing more ammunition each.   \n4.9. Destruction: renders a target permanently out of action, with >30% casualties or \nmateriel damage; requires large quantities of ammunition, unless precision or Term inally \nGuided Munitions are used.  \n4.10.  Neutralisation: temporarily stops the enemy carrying out its  intended task and can last \nfor several hours after the lifting of the fire;  implies 10% casualties or materiel damage.  \n4.11.  Suppression: limits the ability of the enemy to carry out its  task whist the fire \ncontinues . \n4.12.  Harassment : disturbs the rest of enemy troops, curtails movement and, by threat \nloses, lowers morale.  \n4.13.  Non-Lethal Effects : \na. Assists with Target Acquisition and / or Navigation.\nb. Deception.\nc. Psychological effects.\nEMPLOYMENT OF OS IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONS:  \n4.14.  OS strike assets may be used in the following ways depending on the tactical situation:  \na. Offensive Operations:\n(1) Preparation Fire. Fire del ivered before an attack to weaken the enemy\nposition. This and  Counter -Preparation Fire are divided into:\n(a) Close Supporting Fire . Fire placed on enemy  troops, weapons, or\npositions which, because of their  close proximity, present the most\nimmediate and serious  threat to the supported unit.\n(b) Deep Supporting Fire. Fire directed on objectives  not in t he\ni\nmmediate vicinity of our forces, for neutralizing and destroying enemy\nreserves and weapons, and interfering with enemy command, supply,\ncommunications and observations.\n(2) Covering Fire . Fire used to protect troops when they are within range  of\nenem\ny small arms.  In amphibious usage, fire delivered prior to the landing to\nc\nover preparatory operations .\nb. Defensive Operations:\n(1) Defensive Fire (DF). Fire delivered by supporting units to  assist and\nprotect a unit engaged in a defensive action.\n(2) Final Protective Fire (FPF). An immediately available prearranged barrier\nof fire designed to impede enemy movement  across defensive lines or areas .\n(3) Counterpreparation Fire. Intensive pre- arranged fire delivered when the\nimminence of the enemy attack is  discovered.\nc. Stabilisation Operations. OS has significant utility in its ability to directly\ninfluence an adversary’s behaviour through force posture as follows:\n(1) Show of Force. The visible presence of a capability. This could for\nexample be guns parked up, driving about or deployed.\nSERIAL 4-03-04 \n4–03–04 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 12  – May 2020 (2) Demonstration of Force. This could be the well- publicised firing of guns on\na range; the dropping of illumination rounds over a target to demonstrate t he\nabi\nlity to engage with lethal force.\n(3) Use of Force. The actual use of force against an adversary.\nd. Enabling Operations.\n(1) Counter -Indirect Fire (C -IDF) / Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) .\nFi\nre delivered for the purpose of destroying or neutralising indirect fire or Air\nDefence systems.\n(2) Interdiction Fire. Fire placed on an area or point to prevent the enemy\nusing that area or point.\n4.15.  Artillery / OS Tactical Tasks / Allocation.  \na. Direct Support .   NATO defines Direct Support (DS) as: ‘the support provi ded\nby\n a unit or formation not attached or under command/control of the supported unit or\nformation but required to give a priority to the support required by that unit or\nformation’ .  This has a wider meaning;  it implies the provision of the following to the\ndirectly supported formation or unit:\n(1) A guarantee of fire.\n(2) Observers, communications, liaison and advice.  This includes\nresponsibility for fire planning and the coordination of all offensive support atevery level of command from subunit upwards.\nb. Reinforcing.   Reinforcing is a tactical task in which one artillery unit augments\nthe fire of another artillery unit.  NATO doctrine dictates that an artillery unit can\nreinforce only another artillery unit (including artillery Tac Gp) and not an all arms\nformation.  This relationship is a guarantee of fire to the artillery unit so reinforced. It is\nlikely to be accompanied by caveats on time and/or ammunition expenditure.\nc. General Support .   General Support (GS) is that which is given to the supported\nforce as a whole and not to any particular subdivision of it.  It is often used to refer t o\nar\ntillery which is being used to influence the corps or divisional battle and is not\ngenerally available for the subordinate formations.  MLRS tasked with fighting t he\ndi\nvisional deep battle, is an example of such a tactical task.  There is no guarantee of\nfire in support of any other unit or formation.\nd. General Support Reinforcing.   GS Reinforcing artillery supports the force as a\nwhole and, on a secondary basis, provides reinforcing fire for another artilleryunit.  Thus, an artillery fire unit, given a tactical task of GS Reinforcing the artillery of\nanother unit or formation, cannot provide a guarantee of fire to it. It will respond to the\nother unit or formations requirements only if its own OS commander has no higher\npriority task for it at the time. Like reinforcing, the relationship is likely to be\naccompanied by a time and/or ammunition expenditure caveat.\nSERIAL 4-03-05 \n4–03–05 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 AIR MANOEUVRE & ATTACK HELICOPTER OVERVIEW  \n5.1. Introduction . The AH 64D /E Apache Attack Helicopter (AH) is the primary AH \ndeployed by UK, US and Ku forces. The Lynx/Wildcat is a Light U tility Helicopter (LUH) with \nthe capability to undertake tasks but without the firepower or protection of the AH.  The \npreferred engagement procedure for aviation is using a JTAC.  In such circumstances the \naircraft follows a similar sequence to that employed by fixed wing aircraft.  \nAttack Helicopter Characteristics  \n5.2. Capabilities . The AH has the following unique capabilities:  \na. Stand- Off Target Acquisition and Engagement . Capabilities of particular \naircraft vary with sensor and weapons carriage;  however,  they share the capability to \ndetect, recognise and engage man -sized targets and above up to 3000m using the \n30mm gun, with effective armour piercing up to 2200m.  When engaging \nautonomously with rockets and missiles the minimum range is 500m, extending to a \nmaximum of 6000m.  This range can be further extended to the weapon systems \nmaximum range of 8000m if the target is designated by a ground cal l sign or other \nthird party who is laser designator equipped.  A number of aircrew and all AAC pilots \nare trained to operate as A ir OPs for control and direction of artillery, mortars and NGS \nand/or as Airborne FACs.  Aviation platforms have the ability to assess a particular \nNamed Area of Interest (NAI) or potential Target Area of Interest (TAI) from different \naspects in order to provide the information required by a commander.  \nb. Rapid Deployment to the Target Area .  The high speed and flight capabilities \nof AH confer an ability to rapidly redeploy aircraft between firing points and \nengagement  areas and AH has the agility to quickly manoeuvre into observation \npositions that  would otherwise be difficult or impossible for ground troops to achieve.  \nc. Delivery Accuracy . Weapon systems of the AH are capable of precise  \nengagement of point targets, enabling weapons effects to be employed in close \nproximity to own troops or in circumstances where collateral damage must be limited.  \nAH is also capable of acquiring and designating targets for other joint fires assets to \nsubsequently engage.  \nd. Air Ground Communications .  Battlefield Helicopters can provide a  Command \nSupport capability to cover a range of tasks including provision of vital  communication \nlinks and communication through Rebroadcast (which will usually require line of sight) . \nAviation needs to be included in the communications plans at the earliest stage.  \ne. Massed Effects.  The long sensor and weapon ranges of the AH together with \nthe ability of the aircraft to rapidly deploy, allow weapon effects to be rapidly \nconcentrated from dispersed platforms.  \n5.3. Limitations .  The employment of AH is influenced by the following factors:  \na. Availability .  AH has a limited time on station which can be reduced by \ninclement  weather or when operating in hot and or high conditions.  Maintenance and \ncrew rest  requirements, together with transit distances to and from the forward \noperating bases  reduce the capability of AH to provide continuous coverage or \navailability.  When fitted  with 2 external tanks, AH can typically operate out to 250 km \nand loiter for 60  minutes, though the additional fuel weight will mean a weapon effect \ntrade off.  Poor  weather will affect sensor performance.  Protection must be considered \nincluding the selection of ingress and egress routes over uncleared terrain.  Aviation \ncan operate outside the land component battlespace and may be tasked by the joint \nforce HQ.  \nSERIAL 4-03-05 \n4–03–05 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 b. Weather and Visibility .  While AH is equipped with all- weather  sensors, target  \nacquisition and engagement capability is reduced in poor weather.  Poor weather and \nvisibility may also reduce flight performance, or in extreme cases prevent AH  \noperations.  \nc. Vulnerability.  AH are equipped with passive and active defensive aids suites.  \nHowever, they are still vulnerable to enemy ground based air defence systems and \naircraft.  Low flying AH are particularly vulnerable to small arms and heavy machine  \ngun fire and ideally should not operate over enemy locations or un -cleared terrain.  \n5.4. Rotary Wing Close Air Support (RW CAS).  The AH is the best RW platform for \nproviding CAS , under the direction of a JTAC , as it can deliver a wide range of weapons \nand, due to its design, has high levels of self -protection.  The fires capabilities of armed \naviation will be maximised when integrated with other force elements including Offensive \nSupport and Ground Manoeuvre.   AH is particularly suited to close support operations  \nbecause of its ability to loiter in the area of operations coupled with the devas tatingly  \naccurate nature of its weapon systems.  For planning purposes,  it is treated in the same way \nas any other direct fire weapon system.  However,  the notion that AH can hover on  station in \nsupport of ground troops is only true where there is a benign air environment and  the enemy \nlacks effective Ground Based Air Defence (GB AD). \n5.5. KU Aviation .  2 x AH Squadrons  in the Air Force.  Each has of 8 x Apache.   \n5.6. Roles:  \na. Combat :  attack, armed recce, guard .  \nb. Comb at Support : ISTAR, direction of fire support, A irborne FAC, command \nsupport, escort . \n5.7. Range and Endurance . As a rule of thumb, in a temperate climate below 2000’ above \nsea level, AH  and LUH have approx 2 hrs flying before needing to refuel.  However, max \nweapon payloads will reduce this and the table bellows gives more detailed figures for AH . \nStrike Missions (20 mins TOT)  Manoeuvre Missions (e.g. Guard, delay, \netc) \nHellfire  Fuel Pods  Range (km)  Hellfire  Fuel Pods  Endurance (hrs)  \n16 0 183 – 204 16 0 1.3 – 1.6 \n12 1 225 – 349 12 1 1.6 – 3.0 \n8 2 267 – 493 8 2 2.2 – 4.3 \n5.8. Availability . For a Sqn of 8 aircraft assume 75% availability for any given mission, \nunless it is the key  element of an operation and \nthere is sufficient time for additional ES effort, when 90- 100% availability  may be attainable.  \n5.9. Frontages and Sustainability . For ISTAR \nand Guard/Screen tasks in rolling, wooded \nterrain assume:  \na. 2 x AH can cover a 12 -16 km \nfrontage – Sqn task for 9 hrs followed by \nan 8 hr break, Regt task indefinitely.   \nb. 6 x AH can cover a 24 km frontage;  \nSqn task for 2 hrs less transit time to/from \nFARP; would  then be ‘off station’ for one hr \nplus transit to/from FARP before another 2 hrs coverage. Could do at  least 3 periods \n‘on station’ before needing an 8 hr break.  \nFigure 5. 1  Frontage of 2 x AH in \nISTAR / Guard / Screen Role  \nSERIAL 4-03-05 \n4–03–05 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 c. 24 km would be a Regt task for approx 12 hrs before an 8 hr break.\nd.

This will not alter above time spans but may slightly\nimprove frontages.\nf.

A well- defined point on a route at which the movement of vehicles comes \nunder the control of the commander of the movement.  It is at this point that the column is \nformed by the elements comprising it, passing in succession at their appointed times.  In \naddition to the principal start point of a column, there may be secondary start points for its \ndifferent elements.  \n2.2. Column .  A group of vehicles moving under a single commander over the same route, in \nthe same direction, at the same time.  \n2.3. Element .  Subdivision of a large column, each element having its own commander.  \n2.4. Critical Point .  A selected point along a route used for reference in giving instructions. \nExamples are start points, release points and other points where interference with movement \nmay occur or where timings are critical.  \n2.5. Halts .  A short halt by columns or elements of columns travelling on controlled routes takes \nplace after 2 hrs running and lasts 15 mins.  If necessary, a second halt takes place after a further \n2 hrs and lasts for 30 minutes.  This pattern may be repeated up to a maximum of 9 hours actual \ndriving time, after which drivers should take a minimum of 11 hours unbroken rest before commencing driving again.  Where operationally essential, an extension to drivers’ hours may be \napplied for.  Whenever possible all columns following the same route should stop at the same \ntime, but movement planning must, where necessary, allow at least a 10 min column gap to \nensure a following column does not overtake the one in front whilst halted.  Should the \ncharacteristics of the road may make it necessary for columns to halt at a particular part of the route instead of all its vehicles halting at a fixed time, the movement order will specify when such \nhalts are to be taken.  There are no standard rules for long halts.  They may be ordered for rest \nperiods, meals and to enable changes in density to be effected.  \n2.6. \nRelease Point .  A well-defined point on a route at which the elements comprising a column \nreturn to the authority of their respective commanders, each one of the elements continuing its \nmovement towards its own appropriate destination.  \n2.7. Rate  of March .  The average number of kilometres to be travelled in a given period of time, \nincluding all ordered halts.  It is expressed as kilometres in the hour (kih).  \n2.8. Running Time .  The total time for which a single element is in transit. \n2.9. Average Speed .  The average distance travelled per hour calculated over the whole \njourney, excluding specifically ordered halts.  \n2.10. Pass Time .  The time that elapses between the moment when the leading vehicle of a \ncolumn passes a given point and the moment when the last vehicle passes the same point plus, where appropriate, a time gap.  \n2.11. \nTime  Gap. Within columns travelling under 1 movement number, a time gap is added to \nthe calculated pass time.  It represents the sum of the intervals between the columns and \nelements expressed in mins.

Introduction .  This section shows planning figures for rates of advance of friendly \nforces against a range of resistance and terrain.  These figures are derived from historical \nanalysis and are planning start points only.  In reality a myriad of factors will affect these \nfigures as soon as an operation begins.  \n3.2. Adjustment Criteria. The figures in the tables can be adjusted according to the \nfollowing factors:  \na. Degree of Resistance. This factor is selected using military judgement. It shoul d\nnot\n rely purely on numbers of like for like equipment.  As an example, an enemy with\naccess to small arms only, may sit in a 5:1 ratio.  If they have access to a lar ge\nnum\nber of IEDs, or when asymmetric or irregular tactics are employed this ratio may\nincrease in the enemy’s favour.\nb. Surprise .  Where the attacker achieves surprise, the figures should be multipli ed\nby\n the appropriate factor stated below.  The effects of surprise are considered to last\nfor 3 days, being reduced by one -third on day 2 and two- thirds on day 3.\n(1) 5 X for complete surprise (eg the 1944 German attack through The\nArdennes or 1973 Arab offensive);\n(2) 3 X for substantial surprise (eg the 1941 German invasion of Russia or\n1967 Israeli invasion of Sinai);(3) 1.3 X for minor surprise (eg 1944 Allied Normandy landings or 1971 India\nn\nat\ntack on Pakistan).\n3.3. Sustaining Rates of Adv. Advance is possible against a superior force, but cannot \nbe sustained with less than a 3:1 force ratio.  \n3.4. Environmental considerations .  Terrain is listed by type. For detailed planning in \nspecific environments (eg urban, desert), refer to doctrine on operating in Specific \nEnvironments.  \n3.5. Land Division and Brigade Rates of Adv . The following tables (see next 2 Pages) \nshow the planning rate of advance for a division and brigade against a range of degrees of \nresistance and terrain accessibility.

General .  Combined Arms Obstacle Integration ( CAOI ) is All Arms activity to \nintegrate direct and indirect fire, manoeuvre, engineer effort and ground to achieve the \nCommander’s  intent. CAOI must support  overall CONOPS and scheme of manoeuvre . CAOI \nplanning must consider the target  (the el ement of Enemy Force and its cap ability ), loc ation  \n(tied to own SoM) and specific obstacle effects required.   \n1.2. Obstacle Effects : \n• Disrupt .\no Breaks up enemy  formations ,\nr\neduces his tempo and encourages\npremature deployment of his\nassets, creates surprise, hides ow n\nM\nDA.\no Light density.\no Attacks at least half of en AA.\n• Turn .\no Diverts en towards ground, eg\nKA.\no Series of obs encourage\nbypassing.o Use successive obs, strong\nenough to discourage breaching;\nmedium density.\no Often used on flanks of KA.\n• Fix.\no Slows en in specified area, eg\nKA.\no Buys time to detect, acquire,\ntarget and destroy en throughout\ndepth of KA.\no Obs in depth across width of\nAA.o Indiv obs light and easily\nbreached.\n• Block.\no Complex medium and heavy\nobs to stop en along a specific AA.\no Closes exits from KA, denyi\nng\nby\npass.\no Obs must have significant\ndepth.\n1.3. Principles of Obs tacles . \n• Major obstacles  planned at t he\nhi\nghest level.  Detailed sighting confirmed by supported Commanders .\n• Obstacle plan must be considered early and be fully integrated into the overall\noperational design.\n\nSERIAL 4-05-01 \n4–05–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 • Artificial obs tacles  should be sited to complement and take adv antage of natural\nobstacles .\n• Obstacles  must contribute to offensive action.  Gaps should draw enemy  into KA.\n• All obs tacles  must be covered by observation and fire.\n1.4. Constraints.  Obstacles  are only effective when fully integrated into the plan and \nsited and controlled to limit enemy forces  scope for manoeuvre, without unduly inhibiting \nfriendly force  manoeuvre. The fol lowing  factors may constrain CAOI:  \n• Time (for planning, recce, fwd mov of materials and emplacement).\n• Materials (explosives, defensive stores, lack of dedicated engr lift cap).\n• Political, legal, ethical , ROE or other HN factors,  including the influence pl an and\nt\nolerance of collateral damage, may further constrain CAOI.\n1.5. Obstacle  Control Measures. \n• Com mand ers use obs tacle  control  measures to express their intent.\n• Centralised control ensures that obs tacles  conform to the overall com mand ’s\nintent.\n• Com mand ers may delegate authority  or impose restrictions.\n• Zones or belts (areas) should not cross unit boundaries .\n• Unlike zones or belts, groups define specific obstacle locations.\n• Zones, belts , groups and  lines are designated specific letters or numbers.\n• Groups or lines are defined at BG and below in order to integrate desired effect\ninto the fire plan.• Never hold engineers in reserve, but always list an engineer priority of effort.\n1.6. Related Terminology . The following terms are from AAP -6, NATO Glossary of \nTerms, relate  to obstacles, mines and minefields (unless an alternate source is shown in \nbrackets).

This summary is taken from AJP -3.14 Force Protection.  \n3.2. Definition of Force Protection . Measures and means to minimize  the vulnerability \nof personnel, facilities, equipment, materiel,  operations, and activities from threats and \nhazards in order to preserve freedom of action and operational effectiveness thereby  \ncontributing to mission success.  \n3.3. Force Protection Applicability . FP is a joint function and essential to all operations. \nNations have differing FP philosophies, policies, and priorities; however, the focus for FP is \nunited:  the protection of a national contingent itself plus supporting elements and enabling \nthe force  to conduct its mission unimpeded by the actions of an adversary.  In a multinational \nforce, differences should be reconciled, taking into consideration national caveats, and an overall combined joint FP policy should be established, along with appropriate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), to facilitate unity of effort and enhance FP measures.  \n3.4. Staff Lead for Force Protection:   The J- 3/J-5 staffs assist the operational \ncommander in the coordination and planning of FP measures, tasks, and activities.  \n3.5. Force Protection Principles.   \n• Measured Assessment of the Threat . A threat assessment (TA) based o\nn\nac\ncurate and timely all -source intelligence serves as the basis for the selection of t he\npr\noper security alert state and associated FP measures.\n• Risk Management .  FP should be based on risk management, not risk\nelimination\n• Joint and Multinational Interoperability .  FP embraces all force\ncomponents, including civilian support, within and outside the joint operations area\n(JOA), and addresses\nall aspects of the threat\n• Prioritisation.\nFP balances the \nconflicting priorities of \nthe need to preserve \nforce capability while maximizing operational \nfreedom of movement. \nIt is unlikely that the \ncapability will exist to \nprotect all force elements to the same \ndegree  \n• Flexibility .

Air Component Force Protection.  The delivery of air FP demands an \nunderstanding of the airbase and surrounding ground, air and cyberspace environments. \nThis operational \nsetting routinely \ncomprises a significant \nnumber of high- value \nassets operating in close proximity. An airbase will usually \nhave a large \nelectromagnetic \nsignature, significant \ncyber footprint, a diverse population \n(both military and \ncivilian) and large \nquantities  of volatile \nand fragile materiel \nwithin its boundaries. \nWithin this context, FP activities \nmust be coordinated with air \noperators, enablers, collocated units and adjacent ground holding units; any of which may be coalition partners. Conceptually this engagement space is known as the complex air ground environment (CAGE).  \n3.8. Air FP Measures.  The FP commander, embedded within the HQ of an airbase, is \nresponsible for the integration of all FP measures on the base and within the assigned \nground defence area (GDA). In accordance with NATO doctrine, air FP measures fall into \nfour broad categories underpinned by FP C2 and timely intelligence. \nFigure 3.2   The Complex Air Ground Environment\nFigure 3.3   Air FP Measures  \nSERIAL 4-05-04 \n4–05–04 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 11 – May 2017  COUNTER SURVEILLANCE – EMISSION CONTROL MEASURES - LAND \n4.1.

Introduction .  This guide is a summary of material from JDP 4- 00 Logistics for Joint \nOperations Ed 4 2015.   Detail on the Joint Force Logistic component roles, responsibilities \nand C2 is at Serial 1 -01-11. \n1.2. What is Logistics?  logistics comprises having materiel  or services:  \n•in the right quantity •in the right place\n•in the right condition •at the right time\n1.3. Definitions .  On a more formal basis, Defence uses the NATO definition of logistics : \n•Logistics:  Logistics is the science of planning and carrying out the movement  \nand maintenanc e of forces. In its most comprehensive sense, the aspects of military  \noperations  which deal with:\nodesign and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution,  \nmaintenance, recov ery and disposal of materiel;\notransport of personnel;\noacquisition or construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of  \nfacilities ;\noacquisition or furnishing of serv ices; and\nomedical and health service support\n• Combat Service Support. Combat Service Support (CSS) is the  \norganisational support provided to combat and combat s upport forces, primarily  in \nthe fields of administration and logistic s.\n• Sustainment. Sustainment is the actual business  of maintaining a force by  \nenhancing and prolonging its  capability and resilience. Sus tainment included  \nlogistics, administration and the organis ation and resources required to deliver  \nsustainability.\n• Sustainability. To s ustain a forc e is to generate the means by which fighting  \npower and freedom of action are maintained. \n1.\n4. Principles of Logistics: \n• authority •efficiency\n• primacy of operational requirements  • simplicity\n• coordination and cooperation •flexibility\n• assured provision •visibility\n• sufficiency\n1.5. Logistics Terminology : \n• Sustainability statement . The sustainability statement (SUSTAT) confirms t he\nov\nerall logistic resources required and provides the authority to release and commit\nfinance and materiel.   The SUSTAT would normally include:\noThe expected duration of an operati on\noThe essential equipment and availability requirements\noThe level of demand and self -sustainment required;\noPredicted casualty rates for personnel and equipment .\noInformation on the destination climate, environment, topography and huma n\nfa\nctors .\n• Daily Consumption Rate (DCR). The standard metric for use in UK\noperational planning purposes is the DCR. DCR is defined as a unit or quantity of\nsupplies estimated to be the average consumption within a 24 hr period at specifi ed\nac\ntivity. The specified activity is to  be one of the four Defence activity rates: hi gh\nSERIAL 4-06-01 \n4–06–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Intensity (HI), Medium Intensity (MI), Routine Intensity (RI) and In- Theatre Training \n(ITT).  \n• Days of Supply (DOS).  The DOS definition allows for the average day to be\nt\nied to  national rates and therefore is retained with its current definition for use i n\nN\nATO strategic  and stockpile planning.\n• Individual Metrics. At unit level, the terminology of choice will continue to be\ni\nndividual  metrics such as rounds and litres.\n• Levels of Intensity . The following levels of intensity are used for Log planning.\nThere is  no simple arithmetic relationship between the log requirements for each\nlevel.\noHigh Intensity (HI) . A period during an operation when specific FEs ar e\noper\nating at maximum rate or surge capacity. It may be a single period or\nconsist of a number of discrete, but linked periods and will normally be\ncharacterised by continuous contact with the enemy.\noModerate Intensity (MI) . A period during an operation when specific FEs\nare operating at a sustained rate. It will normally, but not always, be\ncharacterised by regular contact with an enemy. It may include transitional and\npr\neparatory phases for HI. This rate of activity may continue for an extend ed\nper\niod and is likely to require a long term sustainment plan.\noRoutine Intensity (RI) . A period during an operation when a Unit,\nFormation or FEs within a JOA is operating at a routine and steady state. Thisincludes patrolling, ISR activities, maintenance, unit level continuation traini\nng\nand t\nransition planning/ drawdown. It may also include occasional, localis ed\nc\nontact with an enemy.\noIn Theatre Training (ITT) . This includes Mission Rehearsal, Joint Fires\nIntegration, calibration of weapons and systems, field firing and wider collectiv e\nt\nraining.\n1.6. Supply \nClasses. In order to engender a \ncommon \nunderstanding \nbetween nations, \nallied stocks, stores and supplies are \nsplit according to \nthe NATO classes \nof supply. The \nNATO system has been split between \n5 classes (although \nthe US mil have \nadditional classes) \nthat give gr eater \ngranularity to \nmateriel sub-\ndivisions. A \ncomparison of \nsystems is shown \nright: \n\nSERIAL 4-06-01 \n4–06–01 - 3 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.7. Lanes in Meter s (LIMs) or Linear Metres.  The standard measurement of vehicle \nspace on ships is the linear  metre. There are two measures of linear metre, both use the \nsame three letter abbreviation (LIM). The military LIM is 2.8 m wide by 1 m long; the civilian \nLIM is 2.5 m wide by 1 m long.  \n \n \n1.8. Logistic Estimate .

Casualty Treatment Definitions: \na. CASEVAC  - Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) means unplanned or occasional\nmovements of casualties not employing dedicated or designated medical capabilities.\nb. MEDEVAC  - Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) is the process of moving any\nperson who is wounded, injured or ill under continuous medical supervision and car e\nt\no or between medical treatment facilities.  MEDEVAC is subdivided into 3 further\ncategories:\n(1) Forward MEDEVAC (Fwd MEDEVAC ) - the movement of casualties in a\ndesignated vehicle with medical escorts from point of injury to Deploy ed\nHo\nspital Care (DHC).\n(2) Tactical MEDEVAC (TACEVAC) - is conducted from one medical\ntreatment facility to another within the area of operations. Patients will routinely\nhave been stabilized prior to evacuation.\n(3) Strategic MEDEVAC (STRATEVAC)  - s to be conducted from intra -\ntheatre medical treatment facilities, to a medical treatment facility outsidethe area of operations (usually role 4)\n3.2. 10 Min.1.2(2)+2 Hours Medical Timelines .

For planning \npurposes, allow circa 2 hours for the conduct of surgery and/or resuscitation.  \n(+2) \nHours Further surgical, resuscitative, diagnostic and specialist care capabilities \nnecessary to stabilize the patient for strategic evacuation should be made available within 2 hours  of tactical evacuation after initial damage control \nsurgery treatment.  \n3.4.

Purpose.  The DLoD are intended to apply coherence to the evolution of Defence \ncapability, which is ultimately delivered by an appropriate balance of effort across all DLoD; if \nany DLoD is omitted from capability planning, it is unlikely that optimal, sustainable capability \nwill be realised through a particular project.  The DLoD provide a useful checklist of \nconsiderations and can be applied widely in support of capability and other military planning. \nIn addition to the 8 DLoD, ‘interoperability’ is included as an overarching factor that must be \nconsidered when any DLoD is being addressed.  \n1.2. Definitions .  The DLoD were defined to ensure commonality of use in the through -\nlife development, delivery and sustainment of Defence capability.  The following definitions \ndescribe how the DLoDs are intended to contribute to the realisation of capability.  They are \nnot listed in order of importance and have equal value.  While useful elsewhere, these \ndefinitions may not apply fully outside of that context and do not necessarily reflect NATO \ndefinitions of the wider terms.  \n \n\nSERIAL 4-07-02 \n4–07–02 - 1 \nM\nAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 DESIGNATION OF DAYS AND HOURS  \n2.1.

What are Planning Concepts and Tools?  Throughout planning, in addition to the \nestimate process, you will use a set of theoretical building blocks and tools, called the \nPlanning Concepts and Planning Tools; or, in NATO, the Operational Design Concepts \n(ODCs) and Operational Design Tools .   \n1.2. The planning concepts  and tools  are a useful aid to help the commander and the \nstaff think through the challenges of understanding the operating environment : \n•Analysing the strategic , operational and tactical  factors  where appropriate ,\n•defining the problem,\n•developing an approach, which guides planning and shapes the concept of\noperations  (CONOPS)\nSome planning concepts such as Centre of Gravity and Phases, are a useful method to \nbring order to higher level tactical plans  where they are complex, sequenced or managed \nover significant periods of time. For example, a brigade conducting a complex stabilisation operation that spans years may find a planning concept such as a Line of Operation (LoO) of \nuse.  The HQ may also choose to display its tactical plan using a schematic based on \nplanning concepts.  The use of planning concepts at the higher tactical level is about \nexploiting a useful methodology; it is not about campaign planning at the tactical level, nor is it a mandatory  part of tactical planning.  \n1.3. Planning Concepts e xamples include: ( AJP-5 Ed A, V2, Ch1  page 3 -6) \n•End State •Operational pause\n•(Initial ideas for) transition & termination.  • Sequencing and phases:\n•Centres of gravity. oPhases\n•Direct versus indirect approach. oSynchronisation, synergy & leverage\n•Objectives. oSimultaneity & depth\n•Decisive conditions oTempo\n•Effects and actions. oBranches & Sequels\n•Lines of operation oDecision Points\n•Culmination.\n1.4. Planning Tool s examples include:\n•Effects / Joint Action Schematics\n•Synchronisation Matrix’s\n•Centre of Gravity Analysis Matrix\n•Risk Assessment Matrix\n•COA Format Templates\n•Operational Framework Schematic\n•Decisive Condition / Operational Effect Table\n•Joint Action Table / Synchronisation Matrix\n•Timeline\n•Decision Support Overlay Matrix  & Overlay\n•Wargaming\n•3 Column Factor Analysis\n1.5. P lanning tools will be addressed separately following this serial.  \nFigure 1.1 Example Planning Tools  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 PLANNING CONCEPTS  \n1.6. End State  Definition .  “The political and/or military situation to be attained at \nthe end of an operation, which indicates that the objective has been achieved.”AAP- 06\n•The term ‘end state’ can be used by commanders at all levels , not just at the s trategic , to \ndefine the situation to be ac hieved at the end of a miss ion. Three types : Strategic, Military \nStrategic, Operational.  Term end state not normally used at tactical level in Land the \nterm “outcome” is preferred.

Centre Of Gravity (CoG):  “Characteristics, capabilities or localities from which a \nnation, an alliance, a military force or other grouping derives its freedom of action, physical \nstrength or will to fight.”   (AAP- 06 Definition)  \n•P\nlanning concept and analysis tool u sed at: Strategic; Operational and tactical levels.\n(See Annex B AJP -5 Ed A V2 Ch1)\n•A\n CoG is the primary source of power that provides an actor  (Friendly, Enemy or\nNeutral)  its strength, freedom of action, or will to fight. It is always a physical entity. At\nthe political strategic level, moral -strength as well as physical -strength CoGs exist. At\nlower levels of command, only physical -strength CoGs normally exist.\n•B\ne it a physical or moral strength, i t is always an entity. An en tity is a thing with a distinct\nand independent existence.\n•Co\nGs have critical capabilities (abilities – what the CoG can do in context of the actor’s\nmission), critical requirements (means, resources, and conditions  essential for a CoG t o\nper\nform its critical capabilities), and critical vulnerabilities  (deficient, missing, or\nvulnerable critical requirements) .\n1.\n13.

Moral \nStrength  Centre \nof Gravity .  CoGs  \nrepresenting a \nmoral strength exist at the \npolitical -strategic  \nlevel . An actor’s\nmoral strategic \nCoG is the primary entity that \ninherently  \npossesses most of the following \ncritical \ncapabilities: \ndetermines (and can alter) policy \nand strategy, commands the \nresources and \nmeans required  to \nachieve the strategic objectives, and inspires and provides moral  cohesion and will to fight. \nIn short, it is the actor’s political- strategic  decision- making entity.  \nExamples of Moral Strategic CoGs include: \n•a strong political leader,\n•a religious leader or organization wielding decisive political power,\n•a ruling elite, and a strong- willed population (or a segment of it) determined to\nprevail.\nAs a consequence, ‘ Gold Alliance  cohesion’ cannot  be a moral strategic CoG (it is not\n an\nentity); instead,  the primary entity that provides Alliance cohesion, such as the political \nleadership can be the Alliance’s  moral strategic CoG. Likewise, elements such as ethnic \nnationalism or  ideology cannot be CoGs (they are not entities); rather, they can be a critical \nrequirement for the  actors  political leadership (the real moral CoG) to be able to inspire and \nprovide moral cohesion and the will to fight.   \n1.15.  A Physical Strength Centre of Gravity .  CoGs representing a physical strength \nexist, in principle , at each level of command. Thus, it is the entity representing the primary \nphysical strength an actor depends on to carry out its (assumed) intent and achieve its \n(assumed) objectives at that  given level of command.  \n• Strategic Level  CoG .  At the political -strategic level, they are called physical\nstrategic CoGs; examples include a coalition or alliance military task force,  a\npar\nticular strong element of national military power, a national security force, a\npolitical group’s military arm, or  even a strong non- military entity in case the mai n\ns\ntrategic effort is not a military one.\n• Operational -level  CoG .  At the joint force command level, they are call ed\noper\national CoGs; examples include an armoured corps, air component forces,  a\nm\naritime task force, a national police force, a regional network of insurgent cells.\nOperational CoGs are normally central elements or constituent parts of the physical\nstrategic CoG; i.e., they should be nested within the strategic CoG. As an example,\nFigure 1.3 Possible types  & examples  of Strategic COG   \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 the national police force (operational CoG) is a constituent part of the national \nsecurity force (physical strategic CoG). The physical strategic CoG is not necessarily \nnested within the moral strategic CoG, but it is chosen and controlled by it.  \n• Tactical Level  CoG .  Although CoG Analysis usually takes place in th e\nS\ntrategic & Operational Estimate, the method can have applicability wherever a CoG\ncan be identified. The key output of CoG Analysis is the identification ofvulnerabilities which may  then be exploited (enemy) or protected/enabled (friendly) or\nboth (civilian). Centre of Gravity Analysis at the tactical level is discussed in Annex\n8B of ADP Land Operations 2016.\n1.\n16. The Contextual or Changing Nature of Physical C entre of Gravities.   Normally, \nmissions and objectives can be achieved in various ways that potentially use different primary physical strengths (i.e. physical CoGs); consequently, identifying the various ways \nan actor can achieve its objectives is a critical step in identifying an actor’s potential  physical \nCoGs.  Defeating an actor’s physical CoG at a given level defeats the actor’s current \nstrategy/COA at that level. This forces the actor to change to another strategy/COA (that depends on another CoG) if one exists, and it might force  the actor to change its objectives \n(at that level) as well. Accordingly, an actor’s CoG might change if the actor changes the primary physical strength used to achieve its objectives. As such, operational CoGs might \nchange from phase to phase of an operation, and consequently, several operational CoGs \nmight exist for an operation, but normally not simultaneously. Still, if an actor pursues two or \nmore strategies simultaneously, each using different physical strengths, and each capable of  \nachieving the actor’s objectives by itself, then multiple CoGs can in principle exist \nsimultaneously.  \n1.17.  Method  - How to identify and validate a potential physical Centre of Gravity :  \nThe Commander at each level of command  is responsible for the selection  of the related \nCentre of Gravity during his mission analysis .  He does this, supported by his staff, and \nconfirms his selection in the Mission Analysis Brief.   The outline process is:  \n•Identify the actors (assumed) objectives  – what the actor  is trying to achieve.\n•Identify the actors (assumed) strategy / Course of Action for achieving thes\ne\nobj\nectives.\n•Identify possible Centre of Gravit y candidates  and validate them using the followi ng 3\nques\ntions :Figure 1.4 \nCharacteristics \nof Centres  of \nGravity  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 o Q. One: Is the CoG candidate the primary capability o r military force  used by\nthe actor to achieve the (assumed)  objectives at that level of command?\nIf it is an important or even essential capability, but not the primary one  used\nby\n the actor to achieve its objectives, then it is a  critical requirement for the real\nCoG.\nI\nf it is not an entity but rather an important condition that must be present for\nthe actor to achieve its  objectives, then it is likewise a critical requirement for the\nreal CoG.\no Q. Two: Does the CoG candidate possess the most critical capabilities\n(abilities) required to achieve the actor’s objectives at the analysed level of\ncommand? If some critical capabilities are missing, then support from the entities\npossessing them becomes critical requirements for the CoG .\no Q. Three : If the CoG candidate is defeated, does this defeat the actor’s\n(assumed) COA at that level of command? If not, the candidate might be a CoG for\nanother possible COA for the actor.\n1.18.  CoG Analysis: The CoG analysis model is used to analyse an actor as a system in \norder to identify conditions and effects that need to be established to achieve own \nobjectives. The most effective way to affect an actor to meet the required conditions for \nachieving own objectives is through the actors CoG(s). To assist in finding ways to achieve \nthe required condition of a specific CoG,  commanders and their staff should analyse the \nCoG using the concepts of : \nCoG C ritical Capabilities, Critical Requirements & Critical Vulnerabilities \n1.19.  Critical Capabilities  (CC)  – What the CoG can do – its primary abilities – in relation \nto achieving the actor’s objectives at the given level in the context of a given environment. \nThe critical capability concept is useful to identify and validate CoGs, as it expresses how an \nactor  can use a particular strength (the CoG candidate) to achieve the actor’s objectives at \nthe analysed  level of command.  \n1.20.  Critical Requirements  (CR)  – are specific conditions, resources, and/ or means that \nare essential for a CoG to perform its critical capabilities.   \n1.21.  Critical Vulnerabilities (CV) – are those critical requirements, or components thereof, \nthat are deficient, missing, or vulnerable to influence in a way that will contribute to a CoG \nfailing to perform one or more of its critical capabilities. The lesser the risk and cost, the better.  \n1.22.  The CoG analysis matrix. The table below provides one method for using the CoG \nanalysis model to analyse an actor’s physical CoG at a generic level of command; other \nmethods may be used. Moral strategic CoGs are analysed  in a similar way. There are 2 basic \napproaches to using the analysis matrix  at Fig 1.5.  \n•Both approaches  start with the actor’s assessed objectives and potential COAs but\nthen take different start points routes around the matrix:\n•Usually, you would identify and validate the CoG first, as described above, as part ofthe process that determines how each actor will achieve its objectives.\n•Alternatively, some analysts might prefer first to identify the critical capabilities\n(abilities) the actor requires to achieve its (assumed) objectives, and then identify theprimary entity (C oG) that possesses the most of those critical capabilities.\nHowever, since CoG analysis is a continuous, iterative process, the order of doing either  box \nit is not important  as long as you follow the clockwise direction of the matrix  afterwards .  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 Centre of Gravity Analysis Matrix\n      Assessed Objectives and potential COAs : (note actor and level of command) The \nactor’s (assumed) main objectives & potential COAs for achieving them, at the analysed  \ncommand level.

Direct Approach: “is a sequential or simultaneous, uninterrupted approach against \nan adversary’s COG, often by way of DC/DPs. This approach may mean engaging the \nadversary’s strengths.”  \n1.24.  Indirect Approach: “The Manoeuvrist Approach...is an example of an indirect \napproach. The indirect approach seeks to exploit the adversary’s physical and moral \nvulnerabilities whilst avoiding its strengths.” (See AJP- 5 Para \n0245)  \n1.25.   An important point in \nplanning an operation is to \ndetermine the best approach for \ndealing with the adversarial CoGs. Two alternative \napproaches to consider are the \ndirect and indirect approaches. \nThe direct approach attacks the \nadversary’s CoG or principal \nstrength by applying combat \npower directly against it. The indirect approach typically seeks \nto circumnavigate, isolate, or \notherwise render combat \nineffective rather than physically \ndestroy the adversarial CoG(s). In some cases, an indirect \napproach may require a series of operations against multiple critical vulnerabilities. In other \ncases, it may involve a single operation against a few particularly critical vulnerabilities that \nhas the effect of creating the required condition of the CoG, but without engaging in direct \nbattle with adversary’s primary combat units. Deciding between the two approaches is a question of weighing factors such as relative strength, Alliance capabilities, the types of \nadversarial critical vulnerabilities, risk appetite and tolerance, the required condition of the \nadversarial CoG, time, etc . \n•Direct approach: Is appropriate when a force has superior strength compared to the  \nopposing force and the risk is acceptable. Engages CoG’s critical c apabilities.\n•Indirect approach: Is appropriate when a force lacks sufficient capability to operate  \ndirectly against an advisory’s CoG, or if the risks of a direct approach are deemed  \nunacceptable. Commanders should concentrate on exploiting the adversary’s critical  \nvulnerabilities that will eventually lead to the defeat of the CoG. \n1.26.  Objectives: “a clearly defined and attainable goal for a military operation, or \nachieving some other desired outcome that is essential to a commander’s plan and \ntowards which the operation is directed” (AAP -06 Definition)  \n “A clearly defined & attainable goal to be achieved” (COPD – proposed new \nDefinition)  \n•Types : Strategic, Military Strategic, Operational and can also be used at Tactical level.\nNational Strategic Objectives : “a goal to be achieved through one or more \ninstruments of national power to meet the national strategic aim.” (JDP 01 (1.29)) Figure 1.6 Illustrating the Direct & Indirect Approach  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.27.  Military Strategic Objectives : “goals to be achieved by the military to meet the \nnational strategic aim (and are the responsibility of the military -strategic commander \n(CDS)).” NATO uses the same term.  (JDP 01 Paras 1.31.)  \n1.28.  Operational Objectives : “relate to a single theatre of operations and are ‘owned’ by \nthe respective JFC.”  (JDP 01 Paras 1.33.) \n1.29.  Tactical Objectives : “at the tactical level, they should be clearly defined and \nattainable” (AFM Command) normally they would be included in the Commanders Intent \nStatement.  \n1.30.  Who Writes the Objectives?  Military objectives are normally given by the level \nabove and included in the mission statement of the responsible command (i.e. UK strategic \nmilitary level by CDS or operational- level by CJO).  \n1.31.  How to write objectives : Focused at the level for which they are written, each \nobjective:  \n•Is a brief statement that clearly defines a single , attainable goal or ‘end’ to be achieved,\nwithout prescribing the way or means.\n•Contributes to the achievement of the end state (or outcome at tactical -level).\n•Is written as something to be achieved.\n•Examples:\noRedland Government deterred.\noRedland forces removed from Blueland territory.\n1.32.  Decisive Condition (DC) : “A combination of circumstances, effects, or specific key \nevent, critical factor, or function that when realised allows commanders to gain a marked \nadvantage over an opponent or contribute materially to achieving an operational objective.” \n (AA P-06) \n•Planning Concept, normally only used at the strategic & operational level.\nThe UK  and NATO  tends to only use Decisive Conditions in its operational -level \nplanning.   \nThe USA can refer to Decisive Points  in National Planning – see JP -5. It is a similar \nconcept . (Do not confuse with Decision Po ints at para 1.71 later )\n1.33.  What is a Decisive Condition? Decisive conditions (DC) are campaign building \nblocks. They are essential for the achievement of operational objectives and, by inference, \nthe operational end -state. They are derived from analysis of the Op end- state , or relevant \nfactor s & centre(s) of gravity  analysis  and then later refined during the estimate process. \nThey are achieved by realising operational effects (OE); operational actions  (OA) are \nconducted to create these effects.  DC should be written in a way that helps make it clear when they have been achieved.  At the same time that you identify decisive conditions, you should also plan how to assess progress towards them  using Measures of Effectiveness \n(MOE). \n1.34.  Determining Decisive Conditions :  DCs are normally created as the result of \nanalysis in Step 1 and Step 2 of the estimate process.  They may be altered or changed \nduring planning ‘ refine’ or as a result of the assessment process , or a change in the \nsituation.  \n1.35.  How  to write Decisive conditions. One way to approach writing DCs is to think of \nthem as the desired condition(s) (or state) of a system or system element that we wish to \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 exist at some point in the future, which we believe will be ‘decisive’ to the achievement of \none or more of the operational objectives.  \n•In planning, we would express these desired ‘decisive’ conditions using words\nexpressing - how we would wish to see them at that future time - to show that they are\nsomething to be established or achieved. Examples:\noControl of the Air  in the Joint Operations Area (JOA) ESTABLISHED.\noSea in the Olive Strait and the Purple Sea CONTROL LED.\noLand LOC SECURED.\noOperational Airports of Debarkation (APODs)/Seaports of Debarkation (SPODs)\nESTABLISHED.\noSOUTHLAND Government authority re -ESTABLISHED.\n1.36.  Effects : “Effects are recognizable changes in the behavioural  or physical state of a \nsystem that result from one or more actions .” \n  ( AJP-5 Definition Para 3.13 ) \n•Types: Strategic Effects (SE) Operational- level Effects (OE)  and Tactical Effects  (E).\nThe UK Does not commonly use the term Strategic Effects in its operations \nplanning lexicon and staff work except, occasionally, in the CDS planning \ndirective as a narrative descriptor.  \nNATO use the term Strategic Effects as a formal part of their planning and staff \nwork, the NID and SACEUR Directive will always list the strategic effects needed \nto achieve the strategic objectives and end -state.  \n1.37.  Strategic Effects : “These describe specific changes required in the capabilities, \nactions and behaviour of specific actors required to achieve the strategic objectives and \ndirectly influence succ ess and the termination of operations.” \n1.38. Operational Effects (OE):  Are “the changes in systems/sy stems elements  to \nestablish the operational conditions necessary to establis h DCs and achieve the \noperational objectives ,”      (COPD 4.27.f)   \n1.39. Tactical Effects (E): “A change which is a result or consequence of an action or \nother cause.” (ADP Land Operations Glossary  & AFM Command para 6-1 8). \nF\nigure1. 7 Showing the relationship between decisive conditions & operational effects  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 11 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.40.  How to write Operational Effects :  Derived from objectives, operational effects \n(OE) bridge the gap between Decisive Conditions (DC) and the tactical activity of \nOperational Actions (OA) by describing what changes in a system.  Effects are written to: \n•Express one idea in simple language, without adverbs.\n•Identify who or what must be affected or changed (e.g. what system elements and/or\nrelationships in the system need to change) and the desired resultant state.\n•Not suggest ways, solutions or means, or infer causality. The effect does not descri be\nw\nho will act to make the desired change, the means to be used or if those means will  be\nl\nethal or non -lethal.  This detail will be considered in the Joint Action process .\n•Be measurable and achievable. Changes in behaviour or system attributes must be abl e\nt\no be observed. Effects should also avoid being overly simplistic, idealistic or optimistic.\n•Examples:\noRedland capital SEIZED .\noTerritorial airspace control measure ESTABLISHED .\noRedland ports BLOCKADED .\nFi\ngure1. 8 The relationship and logic between DCs and OEs is clearly shown in this DC/OE \nTable planning tool used in the operational- level estimate  (AJP- 5 Annex E).  \n\nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 12 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.41.  Action: “the fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim / a \nthing done; an act”  (Oxford English Dictionary)   \nActions: Can also be thought of as the process of engaging any instrument at an \nappropriate level in the engagement space in order to create (a) specific effect(s).\n( COPD Glossary of Terms)  \n•Actions are carried out at all levels.  The Words ‘ Actions ’ and ‘Activities ’ are us ed\ni\nnterchangeably in doctrine.\n•In doctrinal terms ‘actions’ are the planning building blocks that create  ‘effects’ .\nN\nATO uses the term at the strategic level as a formal part of planning; hence \nstrategic actions achieve strategic effects.  The COPD also talks about \nOperational Actions to achieve operational effects.  \nIn the UK, Operational Actions (OA) comprise of tactical military activities that are \norchestrated through joint action to achieve operational effects (OE).   \n1.42.  Tactical Actions ( Ac): “Action : A task performed by land forces to create a particular \neffect” (ADP Land Ops) . In UK Doctrine Tactical Activities were formerly described as \ntactical actions.  (ADP Land Ops)  There are four groups of tactical activities – offensive, \ndefensive, stability and enabling.  \n1.43.  Operational Actions ( OA):  Actions will be identified through the estimate process \nand should be noted.  They will need to be formally aligned to achieve operational effects  \nusing the joint action process, initially during step 4, but in much greater detail during the \n‘refine’ joint action process after a COA has been selected in step 6.  \n1.44.

Lines of Operation :  A line of operation (LoO) links decisive conditions to achieve an\nobjective. Along any LoO it will be necessary to determine the sequence of actions, effects\nand conditions required to achieve the objectives.  LoO are used to arrange operations in\ntime, space and purpose to transform specific unacceptable conditions at the start of theoperation to conditions required to achieve operational and strategic objectives.\n(AJP- 5 Para 3.15 )\nFigure 1. 11 Showing Lines of operation as part of an operations framework schematic  \n1.48.  What  Types of Line of Operation (Lo O) Can I Use?  The determination of LoOs\nwill shape the development of the plan as well as the conduct of operations.

Culmination : “The point in time and the location at which a force no longer has the \ncapability to continue an operation under current conditions .”  (AAP- 06) \n1.50.  Why do Forces Culminate?  A military force will culminate for one or more of the \nfollowing reasons:  \n• Higher than anticipated attrition or activity –  ie not enough combat power remaining.  \n• Inadequate logistics –  ie running out of fuel or ammunition.  \n• Extended lines of communication –  slowing down the rate of logistic support.  \n• Poor or inadequate intelligence leading to an unrealistic estimation of the enemy’s or \none’s own forces relative capabilities.  \n• In the offence, the attacking force reaches its culminating point when it can no longer \nsustain its offensive action and must transition to the defence or risk counterattack  and \ndefeat.  \n• In the defence, the defending force reaches its culminating point when it no longer has \nthe capability to mount a counter offensive or defend successfully and is forced to \ndisengage or withdraw or face defeat.  \n1.51.  How do you Plan to Avoid Culmination?  Planners should use sequencing and \nphasing in their own planning to ensure that operations by opposing actors culminate well \nbefore they can achieve their objective while ensuring that their own operations achieve their \nobjectives well before any culmination.           \n1.52.  Operational Pause : “A temporary and deliberate cessation of certain activities \nduring the course of an operation to avoid reaching the culminating point and to be able to \nregenerate the combat power required to proceed with the next stage of the operation.”   \n                                                                                                                       (AAP6 Definition)  \n1.53.  How do I use a ‘Operational Pause’ in my Plan?  Although a pause tends to \nreduce tempo, at least in the short term, it can also provide greater effectiveness and \nimproved tempo later on. Indeed, implicit in the term ‘pause’ is the ability to re- activate the \noperation in order to regain the initiative and re- establish momentum.  An operational pause \ncan apply to all component activity  or to just one line of operation or one component of the \nforce , for example to concentrate effort on another.   \n1.54.  Pause - Don’t Culminate!   A planned operational pause is preferable to premature \nculmination.  Nevertheless, operational -level planners need to ensure an integrated \napproach to the operational design in order to minimise the requirement for operational \npauses in the operation. (A JP-5 Para 3.17)  \n1.55.  Sequencing and Phases (AJP -5 para 3.18)  The primary aim in sequencing and \nphasing an operation or campaign is to maintain its continuity and tempo and to avoid \nunnecessary operational pauses.  \n1.56.  Sequencing: “Sequencing is the arrangement, simultaneously or sequentially, of \nactions designed to create effects to establish DCs within a campaign or operation in an \norder that is most likely to produce the desired operational outcomes.”  \n(COPD Para 4.27.j.(1))  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 16 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025  \n1.57.  Why do we Sequence in Planning?  The planning team  should determine the best \narrangement of actions and effects to achieve objectives. This arrangement will often be a \ncombination of simultaneous  and sequential  actions. However, it may not be possible to \nachieve the objectives in a single engagement or even a major operation. As such, the operations design normally provides for the sequencing of actions and the phasing of operations. Although simultaneous action on multiple lines of operation may be ideal, \nresource availability usually forces the commander to prioritize  and sequence the actions; \nconsequently, a commander may choose to sequence the actions in order to reduce risks to \nan acceptable level. This process assists in thinking through the entire operation logically in \nterms of available forces, resources and time, and helps to determine different operational phases.  \n1.58.  Phases: “A clearly defined stage of an operation or campaign during which the main \nforces and capabilities employed set conditions for a common purpose.”  (COPD Glossary of \nTerms)  \n1.59.  What is Phasing?  \nPhasing is a way to view and \nconduct a complex joint operation \nin manageable parts.  Phases \nrepresent distinct stages in the \nprogress of the overall operation. Phases are sequential but the \ncourse of effects and actions\n may \noverlap. The actions required to create certain effects in a certain \nphase, may well start prior to the phase in question.   The \ncommander may designate a main effort in each phase. \n•Each phase should have a set\nof starting conditions (thatdefine the start of the phase)\nand ending conditions (that\ndefine the end of the phase).\n•The ending conditions of\n one\nphas\ne are the starti ng\nc\nonditions for the next phase.\n1.60.  What should I call the Phases?  Phases can be numbered or given a name that \nreflects the predominate purpose of the activity taking place in the phase.  Often this may be \nbased on a d octrinal activity framework  for the type of operation or activity . \nFigure 1.13 Showing notional phases of a campaign  Figure 1.12 Sequencing – arrangement of DC, Effects & Actions, simultaneously or sequentially.  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 17 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.61.  Synchronization, synergy and leverage .  The planning team  “considers how to \nbest synchronize actions in order to generate the greatest effect with a given expenditure of \nresources or a desired effect with the least expenditure”. ( AJP- 5 para  3.18.b) \n1.62.  Synchronisation. Synchronization is the arrangement of actions and their effects in \ntime, space and purpose. The planning team  will therefore make integrated use of all \ncapabilities available to them  to achieve their objective. The primary benefit from \nsynchronized actions is the ability to produce synergy using different resources and gain \nleverage through creating effects and their exploitation throughout the operations area.  \n1.\n63. Synergy.  Synergy is the ultimate aim of all synchronization efforts. Synergy is the \ncumulative outcome or result of discrete acts; it is greater than the sum of the individual parts acting independently. Synergy should be the result of effective synchronization. In  \npractice, it means integration and synchronization of actions aimed to achieve the objective.  \n1.64.  Leverage.  Leverage is achieved when the resulting impact of an action is more than \nproportionate to the effort applied. Leverage can be achieved by focusing the joint force’s  \nstrengths, against another actor’s weaknesses and  utilizing also other instruments of power \nin a comprehensive approach. \n1.65.  What’s the Difference between Sequence & Synchronise in Planning?  \nSequencing is the logical arrangement of effects and activities based on their \ninterdependencies.  Synchronisation applies time , space and resource considerations to \nsequences and thus establishes their feasibility. \n1.66.  How do I Sequence & Synchronise in Planning ? Broad Guidance is: \n•Decisive Conditions (DCs) are sequenced in the order they need to be achieved.\nReflected in their position on the different LoO in the Operational framework.\nFigure 1.14 Tactical  Land  Synchronisation Matrix  \nSERIAL 3-01-01 \n3–01–01 - 18 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 • Operational Effects (OEs) are sequenced and may be  synchronised in time, space and \npurpose against Resources in COA development.  Reflected in the planning tools \nshowing the Operational Effects sequenced by phases or synchronised against time (see \nAJP- 5, page  E10)  \n• Operational Actions (OAs) are sequenced and synchronised  in time, space and \npurpose against Resources in the Joint Action orchestration process. Reflected in the \nJoint Action Table and Joint Action Synchronisation Matrix. ( See AJP- 5 Annex E ) \n• Tactical Actions (Ac) are sequenced and synchronised in time, space and purpose  \nagainst resources  by components: eg  in the Land Integrated Action orchestration \nprocess ; Air ATO process  and Maritime planning. Reflected in the tactical missions (list \nof tasks with a purpose) and tactical Synchronisation Matrix.  \n1.67.  Simultaneity and depth . The planning team determines the extent to which joint \nforces can conduct simultaneous actions  to create Effects & DCs throughout the depth of the \noperations area.  \n• This is largely a function of the availability of military resources and their operational \nreach. The intent should always be to achieve synergy by combining the effects of simultaneous actions to overwhelm the adversary’s ability to respond effectively with so \nmany actions occurring at one time and to conceal the direction of main effort as long as \npossible . (AJP-5 para 3.18.c ) \n1.68.  Tempo .  Tempo is the rate or rhythm of activity relative to the adversary’s, within \ntactical actions and between major operations.  \n• Tempo incorporates the capacity of a joint force to make the transition from one \noperational posture to another to gain and maintain the initiative. The ability to dictate the \noperational tempo provides freedom of action and is key to bringing an adversary  to its \nculmination point while preventing the premature culmination of one’s own operation.   \n(AJP- 5 para 3.18. d) \n1.69.   Branches and Sequels - Contingency Options Planning .  An essential step in the \noperations design process in operational -level planning is to anticipate eventualities that may \noccur during the course of an operation and determine alternative LoOs and sequences of  \naction, while still achieving the objective.  \n• For every action there is a range of possible outcomes that may or may not create the \ndesired effects or the expected changes of conditions.  \n• Outcomes that are more favourable than expected may present opportunities that can be \nexploited.  \n• Outcomes that are worse than expected may pose risks that can be mitigated.  \n• The commander and the planning team  must anticipate possible good and bad outcomes \nand link them to decision points and develop options for dealing with them.  \n• This is achieved by developing branches  and sequels  derived from continuously exposing \nthe operations design to questions, concerning situations that could possibly occur during \neach phase of the operation.        (AJP- 5 Para 3.18e ) \n \n \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 19 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.70.  What is a \nBranch?  Branches are \noptions within a particular \nphase of a joint \noperation, which are planned and conducted in response to an \nanticipated opportunity or \nrisk within that phase, to \nprovide the flexibility to \nretain the initiative and ultimately achieve the \noriginal objective. \nBranches address the \nquestion of “ what if ”?  \n•When Used?  I\nn\nr\nesponse to anticipated \nopportunity or reversal within that phase. \n•Scale: Smaller.\n•How :  Same decisive condition, different operational effects and actions.  Normally a\nJ3/5 task  and initiated through a FRAGO to change the existing  Joint Coordination Order\nor Operation Order .\n1.71.  What is a Sequel?  \nSequels are options for \nsubsequent operations \nwithin an operation or the \nfollowing phase(s) of an \noperation. Sequels \naddress the question of “what’s next?”  \n•When Used?  They\nare planned on the\nbasis of the likely\noutcome of the current\noperation or phase  t\no\npr\novide the flexibility t o\nr\netain the initiative and/or\nenhance operational tempo.\n•Scale: Normally larger.\n•How :  different DCs, so  also different operational effects and actions. Normally J5 lead\nand initiated through a new Joint Coordination Order or Operation Order.\n1.72.  Decision Points (DP). Decision points are events defined in time or space on which \nthe commander is expected to have to make a decision to ensure timely execution and \nsynchronization of resources.  Decision points can be linked to assumptions and \ncommander’s critical information requirements,  and they should lead to the requirement for \nbranches and sequels.  \nFigure 1. 15 Illustrating a DP & Branch in an Op Framework Schematic  \nFigure 1. 16 Illustrating a DP & Sequel in an Op Framework Schematic  \nSERIAL 3-01- 01 \n3–01– 01 - 20 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 1.73.

(REST) Restraint – A requirement placed on a commander that prohibits an action; \nie something you must not or cannot do; eg cross an international border .  \n2.10.  (CCIR)  Commander ’s Critical I nformation Requirement: Information concerning areas \nthat are either critical to the success of the mission, or represent a critical threat are \nexpressed as CCIRs. They are set by the commander (though the staff may recommend \nCCIRs) . \n2.11.  (PIR) Priority Intelligence Requirement .  “Those intelligence requirements for \nwhich a commander has an anticipated and stated priority in his task of planning and \ndecision- making”  are categorised as PIRs.  \nFor the Staff to be cleared  with Higher HQ or Managed in the Planning Process  \n2.12.  (R)  Risks .  Risks must be identified, analysed and managed. \n2.13.  (A) Assumptions.   There may be a need to make assumptions during the planning \nprocess where gaps in knowledge and information have been revealed.  Assumptions are used in place of a fact that is unknown; they must be logical, realistic & necessary. \nAssumptions should not be made that dismiss enemy capabilities or intentions & alter \nchallenging aspects of the situation or presume our own success.  Assumptions are treated \nas facts and therefore need to be analysed like a factor.  Once adopted, an assumption will \napply throughout planning until verified as  fact or discarded.  To assist in their verification, \neach assumption will need: Information, knowledge or intelligence requirements   (eg CCIR, \nPIR,) A risk evaluation.   (Joint Estimate only) – evaluated for the need   to develop a branch \nor sequel.  \n2.14.

The Staff timeline is dictated by the events within the \noperational timeline, and it determines the proportions of time that will be allocated for the \nestimate  process. Planning will start when the time higher commander’s orders  were  \nreceived and finish when the orders are delivered. It should be noted that the staff planning \ntimeline can be refined continuously . \n3.4. Determi nimg the Staff  Planning Timeline.

It consists of:  \n•Operational Area Evaluation (OAE)\n•Threat Evaluation (TE).\n•Threat  Integration ( TI).\nFigure 5. 2 Illustrating an overview of IPE processes . \n5.3. Operational  Area Evaluation  (OAE) .  OAE is the analysis of the terrain, people and \nthe effects of the weather in order to identify how the environment impacts on the movement \nand actions of both friendly forces and actors, audiences, adversaries and  the enemy.  \nIncludes:  \n•Physical Environment Analysis.

TE is the doctrinal and strength analysis of the enemy to \nidentify the tactics that are most likely to be used.  \n5.5. Threat  Integration (TI). TI is the analysis of the enemy overlaid onto the \nenvironment to identify how the enemy’s tactics will be applied in the environment.

Human Network  Analysis .  Today’s operational environment is complex. The \noperational environment may have conventional forces, irregular fighters or criminal armed \ngroups all operating in the same geographic area. The human factor is always present in \nthese groups and their networks must be assessed.  Networks vary, including by: location; \nsize; shape; membership; demographics; risks and motivations. Successful networks are well integrated into their operating environment, and are commensurately challenging to locate and track, and thus hard to engage. \n5.7. Network Associations . Networks form because of common outcomes or \nallegiances. Examples of these allegiances our shared goals are below: \n•Political motivated network.\n•Military network.\n•Economically motivated networks.\n•Social/Cultural Network.\n•Infrastructure (Proximity / Organizational) network.\n•Family Network.\n•Specialized or Functional network.\n5.8.

Macro analysis supports strategic and operational \nlevel planning. It helps to develop a network profile and identifies the networks that pose the \ngreatest threat to success in the operational environment. Networks are created by \nindividuals and their nodes and links. Macro analysis concentrates upon a broad overarching understanding of the networks and identifies threat network critical capabilities and \nobjectives, operational areas, activities and requirements.

Threat Network analytical methods .  There \nare several different analytical methods to study \nnetworks at the micro level. Or the sake of brevity the \nMAJCSC focuses on three methodologies.  \n•Association Matrix . The Association matrix\nis useful to organize relationship data and\ncharacterize the links that exist (or are\nsuspected to exist) among nodes.\n•Activities Matrix.  The activities\nmatrix identifies the associati on\nbetween individuals and specific\nactivities and shows the relationshi p\nbetween them.\nFigure 5. 5 Illustrating a n Association Matrix . \nFigure 5. 6 Illustrating \nan Activities  Matrix  \nSERIAL 3-01-05 \n3–01–05 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Link analysis . Analysts use the\nlink diagrams to graphically\ndisplay the strengths and the\nweaknesses of the relationshipsbetween the nodes in networks.The link diagram format is theorganization of symbols \nand\nr\nules. It displays known  and\ns\nuspected linkages.\n \n5.\n12. IPE – STAGE 2 - Threat Evaluation  is the identification, evaluation and analysis of \nthe spread of adversaries and enemies. It involves an assessment of an enemy’s capacity to \nconduct  operations and, from considering their doctrine or modus operandi (MO), the tactics \nwhich are likely to be used in oper ations against friendly forces.  It assesses the enemy’s \nlikely objectives  within the AO. The result of the Threat Evaluation can be an overlay or a \nseries of overlays  showing deployment and tactics for each doctrinal COA. Gaps in our \nknowledge will subsequently  become IRs. It has 3 parts , as highlighted below:  \nFigure 5. 7 Illustrating \na Link Analysis.  \nSERIAL 3-01-05 \n3–01–05 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 5.13.  IPE – Stage 3 - Threat  Integration .  Threat Integration fuses the results of the \nOperational Area Evaluation and Threat Evaluation. It identif ies how the operating \nenvironment will shape an enemy’s or adversary’s capabilities, doctrine and tactics and \neffectively turn it into practice,  the Event Overlay, identifying enemy  potential COAs ( the ML \nand MD) and/or the civilian population’s COAs. A n Event Overlay is produced at the e nd of \nStep 2 of the 7 Step Estimate. The Event Overlay is then taken forward by the COA teams, \nwhere a separate DSO  is created for each COA during Steps 3 and 4.    \nIPE Stage 3 – Threat Integration \nMAJCSC: Note  for DSO  \n•NAIs identified in Steps 1 & 2.\n•TAIs & DPs developed for\neach COA in Step 3 & 4.\n•Each COA should have a\ndi\nfferent Draft DSO  \n Within Steps 3 & 4 \nof 7 Step Estimate  Within Steps 1 & 2 \nof 7 Step Estimate  \n3–01–05 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 SERIAL 3-01-05 \n5.14.

Understanding .  This  is one of the cornerstones of our military philosophy and it is \nimplicit in applying the tenets of doctrine. Fighting power cannot be applied effectively and \nefficiently without understanding: the competition and its context; the operating environment; our own capabilities; and the capabilities of audiences. Understanding helps commanders to make decisions; it also helps them to manage any associated risks and any second and \nsubsequent order effects that could be harmful in influencing the targeted audienc es. \n6.2. What is Analysis?   Analysis is the process of evaluating information about the \ncurrent and past behaviour of a state, system, organisation or individual. Thus, analysis is an \nessential component in the process of converting situational awareness into understanding . \n6.3. Analysis Frameworks .  Selection of a problem  solving framework must focus on \nwhether it provides the necessary degree of granularity to meet a specific situation.  Examples include: \n•PEST  – Political, Economic, Social and Technological.\n•PESTLEI  – Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental & Info\n•PMESII  -PT– Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure and Information –\nPhysical, Time .  This is a widely used and effective U.S. model.\n•STEEPLEM  – Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, Ethical\nand Military.\n•ASCOPE – Area, Structure, Capabilities, Organisation, People and Events (used by the\nUS and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan).\n•Human Terrain .  Understanding the human terrain requires us to understand the local\npopulation’s environment from their perspective .\n6.4. The \ndevelopment of understanding .  In \na crisis, our initial understanding could \nbe limited.  We are \nlikely to know the approximate nature of the situation, timeframe and have \na broad idea of the \ninformation sources we will need to access ( Box A ). We \nwill develop and build on that initial \nunderstanding by defining more accurately the requirement for further knowledge, es\ntablishing suitable networks (human and electronic) and selecting the most effective \nanalytical tool ( Box B ). Analysis allows us to construct a more accurate perspective of the \nhuman domain and to enhance our understanding of how the separate environments interact with one another. This allows us to identify whom we can or cannot influence and how best to apply  the levers of  national power and plan to achieve our desired end -state  (Box C ).Situational Awareness\nCultural EnvironmentPhysical \nEnvironmentTechnological \nEnvironmentInstitutional \nEnvironment\nACTORSLocationThe Nature of \nthe SituationTimeframe :\nMostly UnpredictableInformation sources\nIdeological :\n• Tribes\n• Ethnicity\n• Religion\n• Beliefs\n• Language\n• Ritual\n• LivelihoodPsycological :\n• Fear\n• Motivation\n• Perception\n• Pressure\n• Narratives\n• Character\n• Attitude• Global\n• Regional\n• National\n• ProvincialPolitical \nEnvironment• Infrastructure\n• Technology\n• Science\n• Information\n• Media\nCyber\nCommunities Individuals\nOrganisations GroupsNeutral\nReconcilableIrreconcilableState ActorsNon -state \nActors\nLocal Actors Global ActorsFriendlyHostileTraditional & \nNon -traditional\n             ( )Interaction \nBetween \nEnvironmentsBuilding Understanding\nIncreasing UnderstandingStart of\n Planning\nOngoing \nOperationsBOX \nA \nBOX \nB \nBOX \nC \nFigure 6.1 A Framework for developing understanding  \nSERIAL 3-01-06 \n3–01–06 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 202 3 6.5.

Analysis of the Human Terrain . It is important to examine  all aspects of the human terrain, and to avoid only focusing on the obvious \nand different aspects of audiences . Cultural practices are the things that are immediately observable in a society, such as people’s style of \ndress, greetings  and rituals, flags and other symbols. On an individual level, cultural practices  manifest themselves in a person’s behaviour.   \nHowever, to understand the human terrain, we need to look beyond the immediately observable cultural  practices  to examine what drives or \nunderlies these practices. These social  structures are the normally invisible concepts and institutions that organise society.  \n6.9. The Human Terrain Model .  To help simplify complexity we tend to create defined categories and structures  for analysis .  There is a \ndanger that these divisions are artificial and mask  the subtle interconnected nature of human society and social interaction.  \n6.10.  Categories of Analysis.   The following categories of analysis are not absolute, the context and operating environment may require \nadditional areas to be considered.  \n• Social Organisation .  Social organisation is  the basic building block of society. It includes the groups into which people are born, and \nwhich influence their attitudes and behaviour throughout their life.  On a larger scale, a person shares a language, history and usually \nreligion with his ethnic group. Gender is also part of social organisation, as men and women usually have different roles and  \nresponsibilities in a society.  \n• Political Organisation. Power and politics work in different ways in different societies.  Successful engagement with people in power \nrelies on understanding why the people around them follow their directions. Understanding the nature of political organisation in the society \nis essential in determining who actually holds the power and their influences  within different audiences . \n• Economic Organisation. Access to resources underpins behaviours and attitudes of all people. How resources are distributed and \nexchanged differs according to the type of audience.  \n• Beliefs and Values.  S hared beliefs and values ensure the loyalty  and shapes the behaviour  of members to a n audience group. These \nmay include formal  ideologies or religions  or informal or non- codified beliefs about the nature of the world and of society .  Understanding \nthese values helps commanders anticipate the likely  behaviour of the  audience group.  \n• Interaction . All audience groups have normal ways for their members to interact  with each other, ranging from the language that they \nshare, through their  concepts of personal space, hand gestures and clothing. Differences in interaction styles are often the most obvious \naspect of the human terrain.   Understanding local norms and practices in interacting with others is essential for mission success . \n6.11.  Human Terrain in Military Physical Domains . The aspects of the human terrain described above apply to people wherever they live. \nFor. It is therefore essential that intelligence staff  examine the people in the joint operational environment from the perspective of the people, \nrather than from the perspective of the military environment in which they are placed.   \nSERIAL 3-01-07 \n3–01–07 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 EFFECTS SCHEMATICS \n7.1.

The Effects Schematic is a graphical representation of the effects to be \nachieved with the option to add supporting text aligning each effect to an objective and purpose.  It crystalizes commander’s analysis and should highlight his ME.  The ME is the activity the commander considers to be crucial to the success of the mission.

Importantly, \nit is a visual tool with which to illustrate the sequencing, in time and space, of manoeuvre, \nfires, information, CIMIC  and expected enemy activities. It is typically represented on a bar \ngraph with force elements along the Y axis and time along the X axis.  The content and layout are  flexible. synchronization matrices may quickly become too large to manage as a \nsingle product and may need to be broken down, such as by phase, line of operation or \nactor , to maintain utility.\n8.2.

It is a mechanism that helps a commander and staff to interrogate \nthe factors within a problem, and to record that analysis through deductions to a series of outputs.  It therefore provides an audit trail of the logic upon which a plan is based. The \noutput from the 3CF is a series of staff tasks or constraints, using a commonly understood Staff  Planning Lexicon (See Serial 3 -01-02).   \nFigure 9. 1 The 3 Column Analysis Method  \nFigure 9. 2 The ‘Big 5’ Factors that must be analysed, individually & relative to each other : showing outputs  \n9.2.

Understanding  Risk  & Opportunity.   All operations require commanders at all \nlevels to identify and seize opportunities.  But they also necessarily involve significant and \noften fatal risks. Understanding risk , and its implications  at the different levels of operations  \nis essential  for commanders and staff .   \n10.2.  Military Risk (AAP -6 Definition ): “Risk states the extent to which uncertainties and \npotential events  might have an impact on the achievement of objectives.”  \n10.3.  Military Risk Management  (AAP -6 Definition) : “The process of Identifying, \nassessing and controlling risk arising from operational factors, and making informed \ndecisions that balance risk cost with mission benefits.  \n10.4.  Strategic Risk:  Events that impact upon or change the overall strategic context \nmay, in extremis, jeopardise the achievement of strategic outcomes. e g:  A change of \ngovernment or its policy . \n10.5.  Operational  Risk: Risks to the mission and \nrisks to the force through poor planning or  execution \nand through external influence ie enemy activity.  \n10.6.  Operating  Risk :  Relates to the potential \nnegative outcomes born out of operating technical \nmilitary capabilities.  ie aircraft operating out of normal \ntolerances for temperature.  \n10.7.  Tactical  Risk :  This arises from the effects of both planned or anticipated activity and \nthe results of entirely unforeseen or planned activity –  events of chance.  \n10.8.  The Implications of R isk.  Risk has different implications at different levels of \noperations with actions and decisions taken at one level potentially incurring risk at another.   \n \nFigure 10. 2 Showing the decision tree for the consequences of risk  \n10.9.  Risk in Planning.  Ultimately the commander of any force, supported where \napplicable by  the staff, is responsible for judging and accepting risk.

In  addition, commanders will identify additional risks during  \ntheir own Missio n Analysis; particularly at question 4,  when they consider ‘how might the \nsituation change’. The commander and staff will also identify  and consider risks during the \nrest of the estimate.   This should involve understanding potential causes,  likelihood and \nimpact in the context of the operation.  \n10.10.  Risk in Execution.  Risk will already have been identified and planned for during the \nestimate process but there will inevitably be risks which have not been anticipated.  Where \nthese represent a significant risk to the mission or force they will be managed through \nreactiv e planning or direction as part of the HQ battle rhythm and assessment process.   \n10.11.  Risk  Appetite . Military commanders have always \npractised risk management in military decision making, but their appetite for risk and their approach to it may \nvary widely depending on their level of training and \nexperience.  Recognising the factors that affect his own and others’ perceptions of risk (high HQs and multinational partners) is an important aspect of a \nCommander’s leadership. The perceived level of risk is \noften related to potential losses and gains, and a commander should apply his judgement to weigh, in so  \nfar as is possible, the estimated cost against the potential benefits with regards to achievement of the end -\nstate.  The right attitude of mind is important; one that sees risks not only as threats, but also as potential opportunities to be exploited. Risk analysis and management  supports the \ntaking of calculated risks, rather than gambles, while avoiding unduly cautious decision-making, and missed opportunities. \n10.12.

Risk Assessment  seeks to \nunderstand the likelihood of the \nevent occurring, the potential \nseverity of the outcome (its \nimpact), and who owns the risk. \nWhilst risks have to be analysed individually, the compound effect \nof multiple and linked risks and \ntheir consequences at  different \nlevels, also require consideration. There are a number of techniques and methods, using subjective and \nobjective data, to assess the \nlikelihood and impact of every risk. \nIt is the combination of the impact \nand the likelihood which is \nimportant as it will give the overall significance of that activity or event occurring.  It should be noted that the \nimpact of a risk occurring is a subjective judgement which will change as the context and perceptions change. Commanders may then articulate their risk tolerance level. Attributing \nweighting / importance to each risk assists the prioritisation of mitigation / reduction \nmeasures and aids the development of CONPLANS. A method of displaying risk graphically is shown at here  in figure 10.5.  \n10.\n14. Plan ed R esponse options are not necessarily mutually exclusive or appropriate in \nall circumstances. The options can include the following:   \n•Terminate. Termination removes the risk entirely by changing the plan,  so the risk i s\nel\niminated, or terminating that aspect of the plan which is affected by the risk.\n•Treat . Treating a risk to reduce its likelihood, or mitigate likely adverse outcomes to\nreduce impact, is the most common response. Commanders should consider how\nFigure 10. 5 A Risk Matrix showing example risk treatment \napproaches  \nFigure 10. 6 Four separate risk matrices combined into one to display different categories \nof risk.  All have the high – high axis orientated to the centre.  \nSERIAL 3-01-10 \n3–01–10 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 activity might be conducted differently in order to reduce the threat. Residual risk after \ntreatment should be reassessed.  \n• Tolerate . Provided that a risk falls below the tolerance line, a commander may decide to \ntolerate the risk without attempting treatment. Where the reward is sufficiently great, a \ncommander may choose to tolerate the threat. Risk appetite may also be increased to \naccommodate a specific threat.  \n• Transfer . Where a risk cannot be treated, and a commander is unwilling to tolerate it, \nthe option to transfer the risk elsewhere may be sought, usually up the chain of \ncommand for the higher HQ to ‘own’ the risk and then create plans to mitigate or exploit \nit. \n• Take . Where an \nopportunity exists, the philosophy of \nMission Command \nempowers \ncommanders to \nseize it by \noperating within \ntheir superior \ncommander’s intent \nand attitude to risk. \nTaking risk is a key \nway to seize the \ninitiative. To \nachieve success, \ncommanders have \nto judge and accept \nrisks. Taking risk is \ninherent in effective \nmilitary operations, \nin which commanders at all levels achieve their intent by seeking opportunities then \nvigorously seizing and exploiting them. The nature of conflict means that mili tary activity \nis seldom, if ever, risk -free. \n10.15.  Reserves.  Some risks will occur which are unforeseen.   Operationally, a \ncommander will always keep a reserve, traditionally not less than 1/9th of his force, to \nmitigate risks or exploit opportunities.  They may also warn a reserve to mitigate or exploit \nrisks or opportunities using ‘Be Prepared to’ Tasks in the Reserve’s Mission.  \n10.16.  Dispensations .  A dispensation is required when it is believed necessary to operate \nan item of equipment outside its endorsed safety case (operating risk). Examples include \ndrivers not holding the correct licence, vehicles operating above their gross weight etc.  \n10.17.  Waivers .  A waiver is required when a commander wishes to operate outside of \nTTPs  or formal directives  (operational &  tactical risk) . The most common waivers relate to \nECM and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) . There are two types of dispensation / \nwaiver:  \n• Continuous.  Applicable to situations or requirements that the drafting formation or unit identifies as enduring.  \n• Operation Specific .  Used to cover an identified requirement within the estimate \nprocess for a specific operation.  If approved, this type of request will only apply to \nthose forces involved in the operation and will expire once the operation has been \ncompleted  \nFigure 10. 7 The NATO Operational Risk Template  \nSERIAL 3-01-11 \n3–01–11 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 202 3 WARGAMING  \n11.1.  What is Wargaming?  – A flexible tool used in the estimate process for the \ndevelopment, comparison, improvement and identification of short comings in friendly \ncourses of action (COA).  This is achieved through the employment of adversarial \ntechniques which pit one’s own pot ential COA against the assessed adversary (enemy) \nCOA.  \n11.2.  How can a Wargame support the DMMP estimate process?  - To derive the \nmaximum benefit from the wargame, a significant level of COA detail is required. As such, \nwargaming is most successfully employed during Steps 4- 7 as shown in the figure 11.1 \nbelow:  \n \nFigure 11. 1 Shows when in the estimate process a wargame can be used to improve a product  \n11.3.  When should I Wargame?  – As often as time and resource allows; to both execute \nthe wargame and implement outcomes. Normally this will be only once or twice; normally in \nstep 4, or if time is short, step 6.  \n11.4.  What are the different types \nof Wargame?  - the commander will \ndirect whether he wishes to  \nwargame an operation in its entirety, \nspecific phases, specific objectives \nor individual Decisive Conditions or \npoints within the operation. The methodology employed will largely \nbe dependent on what it is that the \nComd wishes to wargame.  \n11.5.  Wargame Preparation : \nBefore starting a Wargame, a common understanding by all participants of the purpose, required preparation, method of execution and evaluation has to be achieved.  \n11.6.  Wargame Location: The room in which the wargaming will take place needs to be \nprepared so that all participants can overlook the situation display and recorded information. The Blue and Red Cells are seated opposite of each other in order to underline the confrontational character. The Judgement panel  is situated between the cells to keep a \ngeneral overview  \n11.7.  COA documents: For each cycle the Blue and Red Cells will then prepare the \ndocuments and content necessary for the execution of the wargame. This will include a \ngeneral overview of the COA and EN COA based on the COA summary templates showing: \nPhase start state and obj ectives; CONOPS; assumptions; CCIRs; synchronisation matrix; \nrisk matrix and desired phase endstate.  \n \n   Phase 1     Phase 2     Phase 3      Phase 4    Phase 5   Fr COA\nEn COA\nTurn\n 1\nTurn\n 2\nTurn\n 3\nFigure 11. 2 Illustrating the Belt Method of wargaming COA phases  \nSERIAL 3-01-11 \n3–01–11 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 202 3 11.8.

Wargaming \nExecution:  Wargaming \nstarts with the \nintroduction to the \ntheatre situation. The ensuing sequences comprise the \npresentation of the \nrespective Friendly COA \nand En COA to be analysed, the game \nturns and the final \nassessment. A game \nturn starts with the \npresentation of the initial \nsituation, followed by the \nmovement divided into \n“Action“, “Reaction“, and “Counteraction“, and the \nsubsequent analysis & \njudgement phase.  \n11.10.  The number of \nsequences played will relate to the number & combination of all COA \nand En COA to be \nanalysed. In case of two COA and two En COA, \nfor example, four \nsequences will have to \nbe examined. Ideally, for the En COA, the most dangerous and most likely COA have to be \nlooked at as a minimum.  If time is short; judgement will be required to focus on the most \nappropriate COAs.  \nSequence 1: Fr COA 1 Vs En COA Most Dangerous :\nIntroduction to the Operational Situation :\n - Background ; mission statement ; objectives ; endstate\nPresentation of  Summary of :\n Fr COA 1 & Most Dangerous En COA \nFinal Analysis & Assessment of COA Sequence\nGame  Turn 1\nMove\nInitial\nSituation\nJudgement\nPhase\nAction\n Reaction\nCounter -\nAction\nSequence 2: Fr COA 1 Vs En COA : Most Likely :\nPresentation of  Summary of :\n Fr COA 1 & Most Likely En COA \nStructure the same as sequence 1 aboveFigure 11. 3 Illustrating how a  wargame should be set out  \nFigure 11. 4 Showing a wargame sequence of 3 turns  followed by a 2nd sequence  \nSERIAL 3-01-11 \n3–01–11 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 11.11.

What is Decision Making and Military Planning (DMMP)?   DMMP is a formal \nprocess of planning to consider problems and construct Courses of Action (COAs).  \nEstimates are planning tools that enable military commanders to make timely and \nappropriate decisions and to generate plans and orders.   Estimates range in complexity from \nthe extensive analysis and briefings that take place in large component  or formation \nheadquarters , ships  or battalion Command Posts (CPs), where there is a full staff and plenty \nof time, down to the rapid assessment and decisions made in contact by commanders in \ncontact or at company  level and below.  \n1.2. Planning Characteristics.  Planning is a dynamic process of interrelated activities \nrather than a single linear process.   Planning is command led and continually updated.  HQ \nstaff will assist in the planning process, but ultimately it is the commander’s plan,  and he \ndrives its development, underlining that planning is an intellectual activity, aided, but not \ndriven by an estimate process.  Although each campaign or operation is unique, all planning \nactivity shares a common purpose: to translate superior commander’s objectives & intent \ninto orders and activity for the subordinate HQs and units.  This process is also known as \nOperational Art and requires the commanders at all levels to make decisions and plan.  \n1.3. Operations Planning.  Operations Planning is the planning of military operations at \nthe strategic, operational or tactical levels.  The preferred English term to designate the \nplanning of military operations at all levels is ”operations planning”. The term ”operational \nplanning” is not to be used so as to prevent confusion with operational -level planning. ( AJP-\n5)See Figure 1.1 and 1.12 to show how operations planning links to the level of operations .\nWhat is Operational Art?  Operational art is the critical link between strategy and tactics.  \nStrategy and policy guide operational art by determining the ultimate objectives to be \nachieved and by allocating the necessary military and non -military resources.  Strategy also \nFigure 1. 1 Operations Planning  – showing linkages between the levels  \nSERIAL 3-02-01 \n3–02–01 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 defines and imposes limitations  (Constraints & Restraints)  on the use of one’s armed forces \nand sets conditions for tactical force employment .  (AJP- 5 para 1.2)  \nThe definition of Operational Art is : “The employment of forces to attain strategic and/or \noperational objectives through the design, organisation, integration and conduct of \nstrategies, campaigns, major operations and battles.”   (AAP- 6).   \n1.4. The 3 Elements of \nOperational Art .  Simply put, \nOperational art is realized through \ncombining a commander’s skills and \nvision with  the staff -assisted processes \nof operations design and operations \nmanagement , illustrated in Fig  1.2 and \nsummed up  in Fig 1.3. \n1.5. Commander’s Vision & Skill .  \nThe Commander bears responsibility \nfor the planning and conduct of the \noperation.  In order to provide effective \nguidance, the commander must be \nable to stand back from detailed \nplanning to frame the larger context, \nset forth objectives and priorities, \nidentify opportunities and risks, and \nformulate operational ideas that maximize \nthe effectiveness, responsiveness and flexibility of the force.  Commanders are supported by \ntheir staffs, who  conduct  the detailed planning and assessments.  \n1.6. What is Operations  Design?  Operations design frames the environment and the \nproblem, and then develops or refines possible options  (COAs) that give a comprehensive \nlogic to the operation.  Operations design interprets  the Commander’s  vision , conducts \nestimate s and devel ops and then refines  the Concept of Operation (CONOPS) .  The \nplanning team then sequence and synchronise actions and resources in time and space to \ncomplete the  plans and orders  for subordinates .  Figure 1. 2 The 3 Elements of Operational  Art \nFigure 1. 3 Tasks  & Activities within t he  \n3 Elements of Operational Art  \nSERIAL 3-02-01 \n3–02–01 - 3 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.7. What is Operations Management?   Operations management then translates the \noperations design, plans and orders into action by integrating, coordinating, synchronizing \nand prioritizing activity  across the joint functions.  The commander and staff use operations \nassessment  to review  progress.  The tactical  component  level supports operations \nassessment with tactical assessment input.  Operations assessment findings regularly lead \nto the refinement of the operations design, plans and orders .  \n1.8. The Operations Process.   The \nOperations Process consists of : \n• Assessing  \n• Planning  \n• Preparing  \n• Executing  \nAs Figure 1.4 shows, the commander is \ncentral  to the process.  While the activities \nare cyclical  and continuous, they do not \nnecessarily  occur sequentially. It  is \nimportant to note  that planning, preparing \nand executing do not always have distinct \nstart and end points.  Planning is a \ncontinuous activity within  the process.  \nWhile preparing for one operation, or during \nits execution, formations or  units will be \nrefining the current plan, or planning for \nfuture operations. Preparation  is also a continuous activity, even when a formation or unit is \nnot executing an operation.   Preparation always overlaps with planning and continues \nthroughout execution for some subordinate units. The task of Assessing surrounds and \npermeates the other three activities.  Finally, staff must understand that subordinate \nformations, or units within the  same command, may be in different stages of the Operations \nProcess at any given time.   The Operations Process links and gives coherence to the 3 \nelements of Operational Art  as shown in Figure 1. 5 below . \nFigure 1. 4 The Operations Process  \nFigure 1. 5  \nThe Operations \nProcess linking \nthe 3 elements of \nOperational Art  \nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.9. The 4 Activities  of the Operations Process.   Figure 1.6 shows the tasks that fall \nwithin each of the four activities of the  Operations Process.  This is not an all -encompassing \nbreakdown but gives an idea of the main tasks that fall to the Commander and his Staff.  \n1.\n10. Roles of the Commander and Staff :  In NATO  doctrine, t he Commander bears \nresponsibility for the planning and conduct of the operation.  However, he is supported by his \nstaff.  The Commander and staff  have different but overlapping and complementary roles  to \ndeliver the Operational Art  through the Operations Process , as shown in Figure 1. 7 below.  \nFigure 1. 6 The Tasks within the 4 x Activities of t he Operations Process \nFigure 1.7 Illustrating the roles and characteristics of the commander and staff \n\nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.11.  A good commander also knows : \n•To achieve tempo - a plan that is 80% complete but delivered on time is preferabl e\nt\no one that is 100% complete but late.\n•To enable Mission Command  - Commanders  must provide clear and timely\ndirection, particularly in their intent. They must direct 1 -down but always think  and\nr\nesource 2- down.\n•The estimate is a means to an end  - the actual decision the commander makes is\nmore important than the decision- making process. However, elements of that\nprocess, particularly the mission analysis and Intelligence Preparation of t he\nE\nnvironment (IPE), are important components to help inform their decision making.\n1.12.  For DMMP, A Commander Needs: \n•A Staff (Trained!)\n•A HQ (Life Support)\n•Communication & Information System s\n•P\nlanning Processes & Procedures (Estimate)\n1.13.  Pl\nanning:  “Planning is the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioning a \ndesired future, and laying out effective ways of bringing about that future”  \n1.14.  What is a Plan?  A Plan is : “A detailed proposal for doing or achieving something” .\nP\nlanning is the process of doing this.  \n1.15.  What is an Estimate?   “A logical process of reasoning by which a commander \nconsiders all the circumstances affecting the military situation and arrives at a decision as to \nthe course of action to be taken in order to accomplish his mission.”   (AAP- 06) The estimate\nprovides the intellectual underpinning process to the commander’s vision & skill.  It allows \nboth the commander and his staff to think  creatively about the achievement of the objectives \nset.  It is enabled by the collective skill, knowledge and ex perience of the commander and \nhis staff to  design and manage the operation, and to employ military forces.  \n1.16.  Why are \nthere different \nPlanning and \nEstimate Methods?  \nMost NATO nations \nand some force \nelements such as SF, \nCIS and Logistics have a slightly \ndifferent estimate and \nplanning methods  \ntailored to their particular set of circumstances .  \nHowever, all planning processes & \nestimates have the \nsame core activities, shown in Figure 1. 8. \nFigure 1. 8 Illustrating all planning processes have the same core activities  \nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.\n17.

After a short interval, HQs \nplan in parallel but in collaboration with HQ above and below (shown by overlap). Aided by \nLiaison Officers and Warning Orders.  \n1.19.  P lanning Horizons .  Planning involves an appreciation for planning horizons. \nBecause the future is always uncertain, planning should not specify future actions with precision.  Rather, future plans must remain flexible and adaptable, allowing the opportunity \nto pursue a variety of options.   As plans extend further into the future, they become less a \nmatter of trying to direct events and more a matter of identifying options and possibilities.  Key to this is the ability to determine future enemy actions; assumptions on which to plan \nagainst must be made and continually validated. If unable to predict enemy actions with \nreasonable certainty, the plan must keep friendly options open until intelligence builds a \nclearer picture.  The example below shows an example of operational -level time horizons.\nCross \nGovernment\nStrategic\nMOD\nMilitary \nStrategic\nJTFHQ \nOperational\nComponent \nTactical\nCross government Strategic\nMOD Military Strategic\nJTFHQ Operational\nComponent  \nTactical\nJ5 Plan\nJ3/5 \nPrepare\nJ3 Execute\n•FUTURE PLANS\n•CONOPS & OPLAN\n•Weeks –Months –Years\n•FUTURE OPERATIONS\n•Operation Order or Joint\nCoordination Order\n•72 Hours - 7 Days\n•CURRENT OPERATIONS\n•FRAGOs & R2\n•Current 0 - 72 HoursFigure 1. 10 Illustrating Parallel Planning  \nFigure 1. 11 \nIllustrating the \n3 Planning \nHorizons in a \nHeadquartersFigure 1. 9 Illustrating sequential planning  \nNow Future  \nSERIAL 3-02- 01 \n3–02– 01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Figure 1. 12 Illustrating the relationship between strategic, operational -level and tactical level planning\n\nSERIAL 3-02-02 \n3–02–02 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 THE COMBAT  ESTIMATE (7 QUESTIONS)  \n2.1. Combat Estimate (CE) .  The CE, also known as the ‘7 Questions’,  is used in the \nLand environment .  It is derived from the standard estimate but presents the analysis, plan \ncreation and decision- making in a sequence of 7 questions.  This is intended to make it easy \nto focus on rapid understanding of the problem and decision- making as part of accelerated \nbattle procedure.  The CE is designed to generate plans for single, urgent tactical problems, \nyet can be adapted for more complex, deliberate actions.  It assumes that the operating \nenvironment and general tactical situation are already well understood.  It is used for \nproblems to be executed qui ckly (as a guide, within 72 hours), and because of the nature of \nbattlegroup operations it is always the tool used at that level and below .  It may also be used \nat the brigade level  if quick execution is required.  Consequently, the CE can be used by an \nindividual commander or with a supporting headquarters staff.  \n \nFigure 2. 1 The Combat Estimate (7 Questions)  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-03 \n3–02–03 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 TACTICAL  ESTIMATE  \n3.1. What is the Tactical Estimate?   The Tactical Estimate (TE)  is used when the \ntactical problem is complex,  and plans may be longer term and involve significant \nsequencing.  There must therefore be sufficient time (over 96 Hrs) to complete a thorough \nassessment of the situation and the resultant plan may well link a number of tactical actions, \nthrough time and across the Battlespace.  Although it is typically the preserve of the higher \ntactical level (LCC or Division), a Brigade HQ should use the TE when planning a deliberate, \ncomplex, multinational operation, and the CE for subsequent tactical actions.  \n3.2. Process.   TE is taken from  the NATO  APP - 28 – Tactical Planning for Land Forces . \nIt consists of analysis in seven linked st eps, very similar  in format, processes  and outputs to \nthe 7 step AJP -5 Estimate .  When higher tactical level Land units (LCC or Div) are operating \nwithin the context of a Joint Operational or Campaign Plan, the TE estimate will typically be used to produce a tactical plan in support of an overarching campaign/  operational -level \nplan.   \n \nFigure 3.1  The Tactical Estimate  Figure 3.2  The Tactical Estimate  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 THE 7 STEP  ESTIMATE ( AJP-5 Ed A Version 2 + UK Change 1 ) \n \n \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5   \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5   \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 6 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 8 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 9 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 10 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 11 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5   \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 12 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 13 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 14 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 15 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 16 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 17 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 18 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5  \n \n  \n\nSERIAL 3-02-04 \n3–02–04 - 19 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 \n\nSERIAL 3-03-02 \n3–03–02 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT – BATTLE RHYTHM \n2.1. Operations Management . A critical function of the commander is to manage the \njoint operations  area to assist in coordinating and synchronizing joint force component \nactions.  Commanders should strive to integrate military actions and coordinate activity  \nbetween military and non -military actors to achieve coherency .  (AJP- 3) \n•Coordination. When two or more force elements operate in the same battlespace their\nactivities should be coordinated, and where necessary, integrated. Where these activities\nare concurrent and cannot be separated, they should be subject to some form of control .\n•S\nynchronization. Synchronized actions, within the overall construct of orchestrat ed\nac\ntions, is standard practice at the operational level. Synchronizing action often require\nforce elements to agree and commit, in advance, to coordinating courses of acti on\n(\nCOAs) to resolv e anticipated conflict. Synchronized actions may comprise elements\nworking independently (but known to each other) and/or elements working closely\ntogether.  This approach enables the efforts of otherwise discrete force elements to be\nconcentrated, at a time and place that is anticipated to be decisive .\n2.2. The H Q Management P rocess.  The co mmander and st aff use  a number of \nprocesses and procedures,  such as j oint pl anning and targeting, t o support num erous JTF \nHQ r equirements, activities,  and pr oducts. IM, the JT F HQ decisi on cycle, and battle rhythm \nare especially important for the effic ient management of everyday JTF HQ operations. \n2.3. (J oint Task Force) He adquarters De cision Cy cle. The HQ dec ision cy cle is a \nmethod t hat depi cts how command and st aff el ements de termi ne requir ed actions,  codify \nthem i n directives and or ders,  execute \nthem, and m onitor t heir r esults.  The \ndecision cycle has f our p hases linked by \ncommunication enabled by battle rhythm : \n•M\nonitor . Monitoring involves measuri ng\nongoi\nng activities that may impact t he\noper\nating environment or impact\nongoing or future operations.\n•Assess. Within the JTF HQ decisi on\nc\nycle, assessment is determining t he\ni\nmpact of events as they relate to overall\nmission accomplishment. This is the\noperations assessment process.\n•Plan . In the planning portion of the \ndecision cycle, the commander and staff\nmake adjustments to the current plan or develop new plans, branches, or sequels wit h\nt\nhe purpose of successful completion of the overall mission.\n•Direct . The commander directs actions to ensure that current orders and directives ar e\nc\nompleted as intended. This direction is done with the broader purpose of accomplishi ng\nt\nhe overall mission. Tools like the commander’s intent and CCIRs assist the commander\nin this role. The preponderance of the commander’s directing function is conducted by\nthe joint operations centre (JOC).\nFigure 2. 1  Headquarters decision cycle\nSERIAL 3-03-02 \n3–03–02 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 202 5 2.4. Cross- functional organizations that support the joint task force headquarters \nstaff as part of the battle rhythm .  These functional integrating structures provide the \nforums for bringing together members of the staff to focus on specific requirements to \nprovide recommendations to the commander.  See Serial  2-01-02. \n2.5. What is Battle Rhythm ?  The m ethod used to fuse staff effort, regulate and control \noperations is called  the battle rhythm (also sometimes called campaign rhythm  at Op level) .  \nThis is a regular reoccurring sequence of boards, meetings, briefings and miscellaneous \ngatherings contained within a defined time  cycle , harmonised across the whole joint force \nand used to maintain an optimum tempo for all levels of command, location and time zone.   \nBattle Rhythm Processes \n2.6. Activity & Assessment  Cycle:  See Serial 3 -03-04. \n• Activity Review :  The HQ manages the activity currently under execution to implement \nthe OPLAN/Operation Order (OPORD).  Measurement of performance (MOP) informs \nthe process, which may require adjustment to priorities, activities, the apportionment of \nassets and resources, or the employment of any operational reserves.  Done by J3 Operations and changes made through a FRAGO.  \n• Effects Review . Informed by the measurement of effectiveness  (MOE), progress \ntowards the supporting effects articulated in the commander’s plan.  Changes can be made to redress shortcomings or reinforce success in achieving supporting effects.   \nChanges are made by activating Contingency Plans (CONPLANs) and through the issue of FRAGOs to promulgate the change. J3 Operations Support are responsible for the effects review.  \n• Campaign Review .  In conjunction with the effects review, the JTFC continually reviews \nprogress towards decisive conditions and his operational end- state. This process is \ninformed by Operations  assessment, which includes periodic review of the whole \ncampaign plan. J5 is responsible for the campaign review.  \n2.7. Situational Awareness.  A variety of tools can be used to engender understanding, \naid de- confliction, and enhance synchronization. Eg Common  operating picture , reports and \nreturns .

JFPG m ay have a number of specialist Operational Planning Teams (OPT)  which \nare small planning groups focused on specific, or specialist planning activity, with tailored \nmembership to staff discrete aspects of the operation. \n2.22.  Joint Targeting Coordination Board (JTCB) .  The Joint targeting coordination \nboard reviews target information, develops targeting guidance and priorities while preparing \nand refining joint target lists to recommend to the joint task force command (JTFC). During operations, the joint targeting coordination board will also maintain a restricted target li st. \nThe joint targeting coordination board is the primary agency for synchronizing and managing joint targeting efforts. It will: prepare target lists for joint coordination board review and, if necessary, JFC approval; validate changes in the targeting database; and coordinate target material production, as developed through the targeting process . The JTCB would have a \nnumber of subordinate working groups and boards supporting it and preparing detailed staff \nwork  related to targeting and effects . \n2.23.

What is  Joint Targeting?  Joint targeting involves the process of selecting and \nprioritising targets (which are classified as being either facility, individual, virtual entity, \nequipment or organization (FIVE -O) and matching the appropriate response to them .  \n3.2. Legal Compliance .  Joint targeting must be conducted in a manner which ensures \ncompliance with the applicable legal framework, especially International Humanitarian Law/Law of Armed Conflict (IHL/LOAC) principles. It must also be conducted in order to \nensure that any risk of  civilian casualties or collateral damage is proportionate compared \nwith the expected military advantage to be gained.  \n3.3. What is a target?   An area, structure, object, person, or group of people against \nwhich lethal or non- lethal capability can be employed to create specific psychological or \nphysical effects. Notes: The term 'person' also covers their mindset, thought processes, \nattitudes and behaviours. (AJP- 3.9) \n3.4. Full Spectrum  Targeting  Approach:   The full -spectrum approach provides a \ncoherent range of options and effects that aims to optimize military action by avoiding \nduplication of effort, effects negating each other and ensures that the right targets are prosecuted in the right order, at the ri ght time by the right capabilities. It recognizes that \neffects will be created by actions in the physical, virtual, or cognitive dimensions in a \nsynchronized way, and that both lethal and non -lethal engagement can create physical, \nvirtual and cognitive (i.e., psychological/behavioural) effects.  \n3.5. Actions & Effects .  Joint  targeting involves taking actions in one or more of the \noperational domains, using all capabilities available, against a target, in order to create an \neffect in one or more of the physical, virtual, or cognitive dimensions. These actions taken \nand the eff ects subsequently created, can range from lethal to non- lethal.  \n3.6. Target Engagement Authority ( TEA) .  Target engagement authority is the authority \ngranted to a Commander to approve target engagement.   The Commander ’s target \nengagement authority can  subsequently be delegated  further, if permitted, and after \nconsideration for the specified target set, the risk level, and/or use of capabilities and/or \ncollateral damage level.   During planning and execution, the JTF/CC and their staff must be \naware of any national caveats, additional restrictions or considerations depending on the \nsituation that could affect assigning resources for target engagement. National caveats are reported through appropriate national representatives.  \n3.7. The Engagement Continuum.  Engagements and actions can take place across a \nwide spectrum. The engagement continuum and related activities are depicted in Figure 3. 1 \nbelow.   \n3.8. Deliberate targeting . Deliberate targeting is conducted against validated targets \nknown to exist and intended to be prosecuted on either a scheduled or on -call basis. \nDeliberate targeting results in targets being properly subject to quality control, validated and being placed on the joint target list (JTL) or restricted target list (RTL). Deliberate targeting \nnormally supports the JTF’s future operations and future plans efforts.   Deliberate targeting \nalso identifies the JFC’s Time- Sensitive Targets (TSTs) . \nSERIAL 3-03-03 \n3–03–03 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 \n3.9. Dynamic targeting . Dynamic targeting engages targets that due to the dynamic \nchanges in operations, present a threat to force or mission but were not detected, located, or \nselected for action in sufficient time to become a deliberate target.   Engaging these targets \nmay be possible by redirecting existing assets in accordance with the Commander JTFs \nintent and targeting guidance.   Dynamic targeting is normally employed in current operations \nplanning 24 hour period.  \n3.10.  Combat Engagement .  Action against an adversary, in accordance with IHL/LOAC, \napproved rules of engagement, outside of self -defence, to accomplish missions and tasks \nduring operations when it is not feasible to conduct either deliberate or dynamic targeting due to the immediacy of the engagement.  \n3.11.  Joint  Targeting Cycle.    The Joint Targeting  \nCycle is shown in Figure 3. 2.  The joint targeting  \ncycle (JTC) has a logical progression  \nthat aids decision- making and  \nprovides the JFC with a  \nmethodology linking objectives  \nwith effects throughout  \n the battlespace.  \n \n \n  \n \nFigure 3. 1 The Engagement Continuum  \nFigure 3. 2 The Joint \nTargeting Cycle showing \nthe link to component \ntactical targeting  \nSERIAL 3-03-03 \n3–03–03 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 Target Lists  \n3.12.  Candidate Target List. (CATL) .  A list of entities submitted by nations, component \ncommand or appropriate organizations, that are in target development and have not yet \nbeen validated.  Note:   Once entities on the CATL have been validated, they can be included \non the Joint Target List or the Restricted Target List and be considered for inclusion on the \nTarget Nomination List . \n3.13.  No-Strike lists (NSL).  NSL is a list of objects or entities characterized as protected \nfrom the effects of military operations under international law or policy reasons.   As such, \nthey must not be engaged until they lose that protection and, consequently, become subject to lawful engagement.   \n3.14.  Joint Target List (JTL) .  The JTL is managed by the Joint Targets Coordination \nBoard (JTCB) with oversight maintained for the JFC by the J oint Coordination Board (JC B). \nThe targets on the JTL are not finally legally cleared against ROE, relevant international law, national caveats until such time as they are selected for engagement . \n3.15.  Restricted Target List (RTL). RTL is a valid target that has specific constraints \nand/or restraints placed on the actions authorized against it due to operational \nconsiderations.    \n3.\n16. Joint Prioritised Target List (JPTL ).  The JPTL is a list of targets that have been \nlegally scrutinised, risk assessed and have been prioritised in line with campaign objectives \nby the JTCB.  It is derived from the JTL and de-conflicted with all components and relevant \norganisations ; is the end product of the target development phase(s).  \nFigure 3. 3 Joint Targeting Lists & linkages  \nSERIAL 3-03-03 \n3–03–03 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 3.17.  Target Nomination List (TNL) . The Target Nomination List (TNL) contains targets \nprioritized in accordance with the guidance provided by the JTFC , CC or appropriate \norganization. It is forwarded to the JTCB for consideration. The target nomination list \ncontains targets being nominated for the JPTL.  \nTarget Definitions from AJP 3.9 :  \n3.18.  Engagement .  In the context of rules of engagement, action taken against a target \nwith intent to deter, damage or neutralize it.  \n3.19.  Fires.  The use of weapon systems to create a specific lethal or nonlethal effect \non a target.  \n3.20.  Target .  An area, structure, object, person, or group of people against which lethal or \nnon-lethal capability can be employed to create specific psychological or physical effects. \nNotes: The term 'person' also covers their mindset, thought processes, attitudes and \nbehaviours.  \n3.21.  Component Critical Target .  A target requiring immediate response as directed by \nthe component commander and whose destruction is of high priority to achieve tactical \nobjectives . \n3.22.  Restricted Target .  A valid target that has specific constraints and/or restraints \nplaced on the actions authorized against it due to operational considerations.  \n3.23.  Sensitive Target .  A target for which planned actions requires NATO strategic -level \nand/or national -level review and approval.  \n3.24.  High Value Target :  A target identified as critical to an actor or organisation for \nachieving its goal.  \n3.25.  High Pay off Target :  high- value target, the successful influencing of which will offer \ndisproportionate advantage to friendly forces.  High pay-off targets are determined by the \nvalue they offer to friendly forces rather than other actors.  \n3.26.  Time Sensitive Targets :  Those targets requiring immediate response because they \npose (or will soon pose) a danger to friendly forces or are highly lucrative, fleeting targets of opportunity whose destruction is of high priority to achieve campaign objectives. The time \navailable does not allow for the standard targeting timeline to be followed.  \n3.27.

Assessment Definitions:   \n•  “A considered process of appraisal to support decision making.” (AAP- 06) \n• “the activity that enables the measurement of progress and results of operations in a \nmilitary context, and the subsequent development of conclusions and recommendations \nthat support decision making.” (NATO Assessment Handbook )  \n4.2. What is the Purpose of Assessment?  The purpose of operations assessment is to \ninform the commander if the operation is being executed as planned and if the operation is \nachieving the desired results. Operations assessment is critical because no planning \nprocess can guarantee success, and pr ogress must be continually reviewed against \nachievement of objectives so that plans can be adjusted as necessary  \n4.3. Levels of Assessment .  The assessment of the campaign encompasses the \nstrategic assessment, the operational -level assessment and the tactical assessment. Each \nof these levels supports the assessment of the next level.  It is fundamental to successful \noperations as it provides the means for keeping the operational situation and progress under \ncontinual review; using a structured mix of subjective and objective measurement . \n4.4. Assessment is Command Led:  The Commander should review (at Assessment \nBoard) and adjust initial planning based upon the results of assessment, which has been \ndesigned to:  \n• evaluate the execution of activities by the (joint) force;  \n• evaluate the effectiveness of those activities;  \n• show  whether the situation is developing favourably.  \nThe outputs of the assessment process (assessment working group (AWG) and assessment \nboard(AB) ) feed recommendations to the Commander for modification and change through  \nthe battle rhythm; plan –  prepare  - execute planning cycles  (J5 – J3/5 – J3) used in Joint \nHQs and shown in Figure 4.1 below . \n \nFigure 4. 1 Illustrates how assessment feeds into the 3 -decision making and planning cycles  \nAssessment Process in Battle Rhythm\nComponents \nCollect \nAssessment \nData\nPlan : J5\nOutputs –OSW :\nOPLAN\nCONPLAN\nAssessment\nPrepare : J35\nOutputs –OSW :\nJCO\nFRAGO\nExecute : J3/JOC\nOutputs –OSW :\nCoord FRAGO\nOp (tac) activity\nSA inclR2\nConsequence Mgt\nLong Term\n Mid Term\n Short TermHandoverHandover\nEffects \nWG\nJCB \nWG\nJCB\nAssessment \nWorking \nGROUP \n(AWG )\nAssessment \nBoard (AB)\nChanges \nJCB\nSERIAL 3-03-04 \n3–03–04 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 4.5. Assessment during  OP Design (Plan)  and Management  (Execute) : The \noperations assessment process involves four stages: \n•Assessment design and support to planning . This is done during the estimat e\npr\nocess -steps 3 to 6.\n•Development of a data collection plan . This is done in step 7, writing the OPLAN .\n•Data collection and treatment . This is done during execution, mainly at the tactical\nlevel.\n•Analysis, interpretation and recommendations ; during execution battle rhythm by t he\nA\nssessment Working Group (AWG) and Assessment Board  (AB) to inform decisi on\nm\naking to alter current or future plans.\nFigure 4. 2  Illustrating how assessment of planning concepts  and the OSW that is then changed if required  \nAssessment Categories and Terminology  \n4.6. Measure of Performance (MOP) : “A criterion that is tied to measuring task \naccomplishment in order to assess friendly actions. ” (AAP- 6) This is a metric used t o\nm\neasure the completion of actions (not just those undertaken): ‘ Are we doing things right? ’\nE\ng Battle Damage Assessment.  \n4.7. Measure of Effectiveness (MOE) “A criterion used to assess changes in system \nbehaviour, capability, or operating environment, tied to measuring the attainment of an end \nstate, achievement of an objective, or creation of an effect”  (AAP- 15)  This is a  metric used\nto measure a current ‘system state’ and to inform achievement of intended and unintended \noperational effects that are caused as a result of actions: “Are doing the right things ?”\n4.8. Operational -level Operations  Assessment . This focuses  on the desired effects \nand is aligned with the planning horizons to support both operations synchronization ( J3/5 \nmid-term planning) and operations planning ( J5 long-term planning). This distinction is not a \nfundamental delineation between a mid-term and a long- term operations assessment but \nrather a difference in emphasis. An assessment of progress towards the end of the current \nphase or upcoming decisive conditions is required to support course of action development \nor adjustment and, possibly, branch planning; whereas an assessment of progress towards \n\nSERIAL 3-03-04\n3–03–04 - 3\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020the achievement of objectives is required to support planning for sequels, termination  and\nt\nransition.\n4.9. Tactical -level Operations Assessment .  At the tactical level operations assessment\nmeasures the achievement of planned actions, tasks or activities for each particular\ncomponent.\n4.10. Branch Plans – developed as a CONPLAN to provide alternative ways and means\nto achieve the same DC.\n4.11. Seque ls – developed as a CONPLAN to provide a method for dealing wit h\nal\nternative outcomes from a phase. (ie: if the outcome is as expected we do ‘A’; if the result\nis unexpected, we do ‘B’)\n4.12. Assessment  Approaches .  The are 4 basi c approaches to designing the\nMeasures of Effectiveness:\n•Quantitative : A number representing an amount.\n•Qualitative : An observation that represents a category.\n•Objective : Facts and the measurement of things or concepts that actually exist i.e.\nNOT influenced by personal feelings, experience or opinions.\n•Subjective : An individual’s personal opinion, experience and judgement i.e. ‘Gut’\nfeeling.\n4.13. How t o Design Measures of Effectiveness .  Measurement o f effectiveness  should \nprovide clear indications of change and effect.  However, absolute, unequivoc al \nmeasurement will rarely be achievable.  In particular, influence and CIMIC activities , which  \nseek to realise s ubtle psychological effects , sometimes over protracted periods, may be very  \ndifficult to measure.  Kinetic  fires to achieve physical destruction effects are much easier to  \nmeasure as the link between activity and effect is often clear.

A graphical, traffic light system  and trend arrows (see Figure 4.4 ) may be useful in \nvisualising movement towards objectives. However, red should not necessarily be taken to \nsignify failure, nor green to indicate overall success.  Both colours only relate to its current \nState.

T erminology : The terms below may appear to be close in meaning but have\ndistinct definitions in military use:  \n•Directives:  Used at the higher levels of command to give both general and specifi c\ngui\ndance to subordinate commanders on the outline CONOPS and to start planni ng\nac\ntivity.  It may/may not include missions to subordinates.\n•Plans: these provide the detailed CONOPS for a specified period of time and trigger t he\ndet\nailed synchronisation of military activities or actions.  Plans have no executiv e\naut\nhority until activated by an order.\n•Orders :  These are defined as “a communication, written, oral or by signal, which convey\ninstructions from a superior to a subordinate”.  They include sufficiently detail ed\ni\nnstructions to subordinates (in the form of missions & tasks with coordinated timings) s o\nt\nhey can deliver specific planned activities or required effects.\n•Instructions :  These are used to regulate routine, repeating military activity such as\norganisational responsibilities & routine administrative procedures or actions & ar e\nnor\nmally developed from SOPs. Formal instructions carry the equivalent authority to\ndirectives or orders. (eg HQ Standard Operating Instructions (SOIs) are used to amplify\nand shape HQ SOPs to local conditions).\nFigure 1. 1 Illustrates the operational staff work products produced by the CJTF HQ and component HQs  \nOr single document\nCampaign Plan \nor CONOPSExample Joint HQ & Component  OSW Outputs :\nForce Instruction Document (FID)\nOperation Plan\n(OPLAN )\nJoint \nCoordination \nOrder (JCO)\nFragmentary \nOrder (FRAGO )Time\nFuture \nTi me \nHorizon\nCurrent  \nTi me Refine  OSW\n to Increase  Level\n of Detail & \nSynchronisation\n as get closer\nto Execution\nGeneral\n Det ail\nSpecific\nSy nchronised\nDet ail\nJ5\nFUPLANS\nJ3/5\nFUOPS\nJ3/3\nCUOPSMaritime Land Air\nOPORD\nOPGEN\nOPTASK\nOPLAN\nOPORD\nFRAGO\nJoint Air \nOp erations \nPlan (JAOP )\nAir \nOp erations \nDirective \n(AOD)\nAir Tasking\nOrder (ATO)\nSpecial \nInstructions \n(SPINS )\nOPLAN  \nOPORD  \nFRAGO  \nSERIAL 3-04-01 \n3–04–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 Common principles of OSW : \n1.3. Timeliness .  OSW delivered late to subordinate HQs will give them insufficient \ntime to conduct their own planning and ultimately may lead to failure as execution \nwill be impossible.  An imperfect plan or order, on time, is better than a perfect plan delivered late.  \n1.4. Approach .  Where possible, we use template SOP formats to aid \nunderstanding and promote standardised procedure.  However, creativity to clearly communicate the commander ’s intentions should be encouraged.  \n1.5. Composition. Directives; Plans; Orders & Instructions should be:  \n•Concise: Only write enough detail that is necessary for a subordinate to achieve his\nmission.  Do not prescribe anything to a subordinate commander that he, with a fullerknowledge of the local conditions, should be better to decide himself. Otherwise you willconstrain his initiative.\n•Clear .  There should be no scope for ambiguity. Choose your words carefully and us\ne\nt\nhe correct staff duties and conventions.\n•Accurate.  Check & validate all factual data such as grid references, timings, orbats and\nROE.\n1.6. Annexes: The main purpose of annexes is to keep the basic text of OSW short.  \nAnnexes provide amplifying information that is not appropriate in the main OSW document, \nor information that amplifies a specific aspect.  \n1.7. Op Staff Duties: General Points. The main rule is that in operational writing the \nmaximum use is to be made of abbreviations and the text is to be written in note form to save time and space, remembering always that the meaning remains clear.  Paragraph \nheadings can form part of the opening of a sentence, eg ‘Ammo. Issued 1300 hrs’. Note that the syntax rules of JSP 101 apply, but the remaining conventions will not. \nMinor Rules . \n1.8. Exercise Protective Markings. In exercise protective markings the word \n‘EXERCISE’ is always to be abbreviated to ‘EX’, eg ‘EX SECRET’.  \n1.9. Proper Nouns. Proper nouns are written in capital letters, eg ‘SWINDON’, ‘River \nTONE’. 1.10.  Composite Nouns. Any composite noun, or one containing a prefix or suffix is to be \nabbreviated by abbreviating that part of it for which there is an authorised abbreviation, eg \n‘mob’ (mobilisation), ‘demob’ (demobilisation). \n1.11.  Abbreviations. Only those recognised abbreviations included may be used without \nan introduction. Where unofficial abbreviations are to be used they are to be introduced into \nthe order correctly. Some abbreviations indicate both the singular and plural. If the addition \nof an ‘s’ is necessary,  it is always placed at the end of the abbreviation eg: ‘CinCs’ \n(Commanders in Chief). An ‘s’ may be added only to the abbreviation of a noun; it is never to \nbe added to the abbreviation of a verb, eg ‘follows’ should be abbreviated to ‘fol’.  \n1.12.  Times . Times are to be expressed using the 24 -hour clock and the time zone suffix, \nunless an expedient such as ‘Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: BRAVO’ is inserted \nbelow the references.  \n1.13.  Description of Attachments/Detachments . Units which have elements detached \nare to be described using the convention illustrated below. The quantity of units/sub -units is \nalways written in full eg: 20 Armd Bde (less two bns) or 1 R IRISH (less one coy).  \nSERIAL 3-04-01 \n3–04–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 1.14.  Reported Speech . Reported speech is written as spoken without abbreviations and \nindented in single inverted commas. For example:  \nWe captured 3 offrs and 2 NCOs. They revealed en morale to be very poor. One of the \nNCOs said: ‘We have had no food supplied since 3 o’clock on Thursday of last week and we were promised that large stocks would be captured on the objective.’  \nGround Locations, Areas and Boundaries. \n1.15.  Locations and Points on the Ground. Locations and points on the ground may be \ndescribed by Grid Reference or by giving the direction and distance from a simple reference \npoint.  \n1.16.  Cardinal Points.  The 4 cardinal points of the compass are written in full, eg south. \nFor intermediate points the letters N, S, E and W are used, eg NE, SSW. Points of the \ncompass should always be considered in clockwise order from north.  \n1.17.  Names of Places and Features.  The names of places and features are spelt \nexactly as on the map in use, except that the word ‘River’, written in full, is to precede the names of all rivers regardless of the language in which this word appears on the map. The \ngrid reference  is to be given the first time the name of the place or feature occurs. It should \nbe shown as a bigram map code followed by the grid reference number, eg: ‘CN 493246’.  \n1.18.  Roads, Tracks and Railways.  Roads, tracks and railways are described by the \nnames of  places located on them. The word ‘road’, ‘track’ or ‘railway’ is to precede the place \nnames,  eg ‘railway Winchester -Basingstoke’. Sufficient place names should be used to \nensure the correct road / track / railway is identified.  \n1.19.  River banks.  Riverbanks  are described as right or left from the point of view of an  \nobserver facing downstream or, if this cannot be done, by issuing  cardinal points. ‘Near’ and  \n‘far’ may be used with reference to friendly forces involved in river crossing operations.  \n1.20.  Canals.  The names of a canal, or names of places on it, are used to describe a \ncanal. The banks are usually described by means of the cardinal points, eg: ‘the north bank \nof the Kiel  Canal’.  \n1.21.  Routes.  When movement is involved, a route is described by a sequence of points \non the route named, in the direction of movement. When no movement is involved, the \nsequence of points named is to be from left to right or rear to front, assuming that the person \ndesignating the route is facing the enemy. Cardinal points may be added if required. It is \ncommon to give a route a nickname for ease of reference.  \n1.22.  Areas .  An area is described by taking the northernmost point first and giving the  \nremaining points in clockwise order.  \n1.23.  Ground/Positions .  Ground and positions are described from left to right and front to \nrear facing the enemy. To avoid confusion, cardinal points may be used to describe flanks, \nrather than ‘left’ or ‘right’.  \n1.24.  Boundaries.  Boundaries are designated by easily distinguishable features on the \nground in the sequence in which they occur. They are to be described from rear to front during an advance and from front to rear in defence and withdrawal. If generally parallel to \nthe front, eg rear boundaries, they are to be described from left to right facing the enemy.  \nCardinal points may be added if required. When describing boundaries between units and formations, the words ‘inclusive’ or ‘exclusive’ are used before the place to which they refer. \nThe description of a boundary must state specifically to which unit or formation an area or a point is inclusive or exclusive.  \n1.25.  Directions. A direction may be indicated in one of 3 ways:  \noBy use of 2 locations or places, eg ‘direction Hannover -Dortmund’.\nSERIAL 3-04-01 \n3–04–01 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 oAs a point of the compass, eg ‘north’, ‘SE’.\noUsing a compass bearing, eg ‘5600 mils’.\n1.26.  Time. Time is specified using the 24 hour clock. The first pair of digits define the hour \nand the second pair the minutes past the hour, eg 1147 is 47 minutes past 11 o’clock in the \nmorning. The following rules should be noted:  \noQuoting the Time . The time can be followed by a time zone suffix or the wor d\n‘h\nours’ if  confusion with other figures is possible, eg: 1432 or 1432 hrs.\noMidnight . The word midnight is not to be used. The time 0000 hours defines the\ntime and the date defines the day, eg It is common practice to use either 2 359\nhour\ns or 0001  hours to avoid confusion. The term ‘2400 hrs’ is never to be us ed\nas\n a time of day.\noDate Time Groups . Date time groups are a method of showing times and dates\nin signal  messages or operation orders.

This section contains 3 tables of definitions for effects and actions\nterms used within mission terminology and associated tactical graphics.   Wherever possible,\nNATO definitions are used in order to enhance communication and interoperability while\nminimising the risks of misunderstandings. Where no NATO definition exists, UK only\nterminology has been included and the term highlighted in red.  It is advisable to provide\nthe UK definition to allies when UK terminology is used in the absence of a comparableNATO term. Note that some coalition  partners may  not define terminology similarly.\nEffects Terms and Task Verbs\n3.2. E\nffects : Effects are the change brought about in a target by the consequence of\naction or activity ; but may also be achieved by other effects. Effects are therefore the\ncommander’s desired outcome in relation to the enemy, population, terrain of friendly forces.Effects may be required in the physical domain, the cognitive domain, the virtual domain – or\nall three.\n•Planning: At the tactical level, an effect contributes to the achievement of anobjective. The different ways to achieve the effects will usually form the basis ofdiffering COAs.\noConcentrate on matching the right action to the intended effect.\noEffects can be created by one action or multiple actions. Like dominoes,effects can be created by other effects. Measuring effects using MOErequires subjective and objective analysis.\n•OSW : Within orders, effects are articulated in the commander’s intent , the\nScheme of Manoeuvre and in the unifying purpose of subordinates’ missions.\n3.3. Actions (or Task Verb ): An action or task verb , describes physical or observable\nactivities to cause the desired effect. All actions have consequences, some desired and\nsome undesired. Subordinates are directed to conduct specific actions to achieve desired\neffects\n•Planning: Actions are delivered using the 4 ‘levers’ of joint action (fires,\nmanoeuvre, information and CIMIC).\noActions are usually easier to meas ure/observe using MOP.\noIf\n the desired effect is not being achieved, then the action should be\nchanged.\n•OSW\n: Use actions to describe how effects are to be achieved.  Use task verbs in\nthe SoM\n and in mission statements.  Actions should never be described in the\nintent statement.  Only authorised actions terms should be used in order to aid\ncomprehension.  Actions should be written in full capitals to differentiate from\neveryday\n language.\n3.4. CSS Speci\nfic Effects/ Actions .

What is a Mission Statement ?  “A clear, concise statement of the task(s) to be \nperformed and the purpose of the mission. ” (AAP- 6) \nMISSION  \n \n  \n \nTask (What is to be done)  + Purpose (Why is it to be done)  \n  \n5.2. Task .  A task is something you have been told to do (specified) or must do (implied) \nto achieve the specified.  Tasks can be objectives, effects and actions.  Multiple tasks can be \ngiven to subordinates.  \n5.3. What is a Concept of Operations (CONOPS)?   “A clear and concise statement of \nthe line of action chosen by a commander in order to accomplish his given mission.”  (AAP- 6) \n5.4. Developing Mission Statements .   A mission statement is a clear and direct order \nto a subordinate and consists of Action / Task verbs and a unifying purpose (Effect), traditionally preceded by the words ‘in order to’. There are three  types of mission:  \n• A single statement with a unifying purpose.  A superior commander should strive \nto give a minimum of tasks to each subordinate. Therefore the simplest type of mission, and that usually most applicable at lower levels of command, contains only \none task.  \n• A series of tasks with a unifying purpose . It is better to be explicit and list \nspecified tasks for subordinates with a unifying purpose.  \n• For reserves, a series of ‘be prepared to’ (BPT) tasks, without a unifying purpose.  \nAt the operational level a mission may be a mixture of all three types.  \n5.5. Use of Missions in OSW .  Missions should be listed in a logical order of activity \nrather than in service precedence as this will aid the visualisation of the operation. Tasks \ncontained within mission statements should be substantive.  Lesser tasks, such as \nconducting prelim moves or establishing liaison will normally be omitted from the mission, \nbut may be included elsewhere in the orders, normally in coordinating instructions.  Missions \nwill often be writ ten personally by the commander and  should contains the elements of who, \nwhat, when, wher e, and why.  \n5.6. Example:  GOLD JTF Mission:  \n“Support Gov of SOUTHLAND (GoS) in the restoration of territorial integrity, the deterrence \nof Red Alliance  influence and the defeat of NORTHLAND aggression in the border areas  in \norder to re -establish territorial integrity and create the conditions for  long term stability in \nSOUTHLAND.  \nTasks : \n1.

LAND Tactical Mission s:  At the tactical level, ‘what a commander is to achieve’ is \ngiven to him in his mission, which should be described in terms of tasks, normally written as  \nobjectives, Effects, Actions or  Task verbs  (see 3 -03-03), with a unifying purpose.    \n5.\n9. Example Land Brigade Mission.  Mission with 2 tasks and a unifying purpose: \n19 Mech Bde is to DEFEND between Line OWL and Line EAGLE to: \n•Draw en into Obj LANCE.\n•Prevent en pen of Line EAGLE.\nIn order to set conditions for a Div Counter -attack.  \n5.10.  Example Land Unit Mission.  This unit level example has 3 tasks  with a unifying \npurpose and shows who , what , when, where , and why. \nKRH Battlegroup  (who)  (2,1).

Formulating Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) .  The concept of operations \ndescribes how the commander intends to achieve his mission.  It is drafted in the estimate \nprocess, steps 3 and 4.  It has three main elements:  \n•Intent Statement\n•Scheme of Manoeuvre\n•Main Effort.\nSERIAL 3-04-05 \n3–04–05 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 It can also have a statement of what the end -state is – normally only used at operational or \nhigher (component) tactical level.  \n5.12.  Intent Statement :  The commander’s effects schematic produced in step 2 of the \nestimate process  leads to the intent statement.  The intent statement should be written by \nthe commander personally to express what  he wants to achieve and why.  The intent must \nbe written in language that the reader will understand, noting that they may be from another \nnation or be civilian.  A possible sequence for writing an Intent is: \n•Purpose (Why)  - Describe the overall purpose of what it is you are trying to achiev e\n(\nthe Outcome).\n•Method (What)  - Describe the Objectives and the Effects using time , space or\npurpose to group them.\n•End-state  - Summarise what success looks like and indicate what next.\n5.13.  Number of Words .  Intent  statements at the lower tactical level, Land Brigade and \nbelow may be quite short and brief.  However, operational commander’s or component \ncommander’s Intents for campaigns will be considerably longer, as much as a full A4 sized \npage as the complexity and duration is much bigger.   Critically, The intent helps the force \npursue the mission without further orders, even when actions do not unfold as planned  and it \nenables exploitation when the execution unfolds more favourable than expected. Thus, if an \nunant icipated situation arises, participating commanders understand the purpose of the \nforthcoming action well enough to act decisively and within the bounds of the higher  \ncommander’s intent.  \n5.14.  Example Intent at Land Brigade  level : \n•I intend to enable the destruction of the enemy’s 80 (Sep) MR Bde by 20 Armd Bde.\n•We will FIND 80 (Sep) MR Bde axis of advance as early as possible, and DISRUP T\nhi\ns advance to EA TIGER.  BLOCK his lead echelons from exiting EA TIGER,\nthereby FIXING 80 (Sep) MR Bde so that it can be DESTROYED in detail.\n•At the end of this operation 80 (Sep) MR Bde will CLEARED from EA TIGER, and 4\nBde will begin its ADVANCE to the International Border.\n5.15.  Scheme of Manoeuvre (SoM) :  The SoM expands the Intent; to describe how the \ncommander sees his operation unfolding.  SoM  sets out  the method to achieve the change \nidentified in the Intent.  It explains the additional detail of how , in relation to each other, the \nforce’s  subordinate elements are to achieve the overall  purpose .  It is vital that  subordinates \ncan understand their roles in the plan; what actions they need to accomplish and the effects \nthat they and others are to realise.  Because it is related to time, a SoM can only be \ncompleted once the Sync Matrix has been confirmed.  A clear intent should minimise the \nlength of the SoM.    \n5.16.  Main Effort (ME):   The ME is that activity that the commander considers crucial to \nthe success of the mission. He must give it substance by allocating sufficient resources to \nthe unit assigned to it. Illuminating the ME ensures that when the situation becomes more \nconfusing that activity will be remembered and provide the rallying point of effort. ME may  \nchange throughout an operation. It should be expressed as an action together, if possible,  \nwith the  primary force undertaking it.  \n5.17.  Example JTF Main Effort : \n•Phase 1:  Successful deterrence of further NORTHLAND aggression. (ACC)\n•Phase 2:  Restoration of territorial integrity of SOUTHLAND. (LCC)\n•Phase 3:  Successful hand- over for sole security responsibility to an increasingly\nconfident and capable SOUTHLAND Armed Forces.

This SOHB Serial combines the theory of how to plan a briefing to \ncommunicate  information along with the agenda and format of a number of common \nbriefings.  \nEffective Communication  Overview  \n6.2. Good commanders and staff officers have the attributes to be able to think and \ndecide, organise, and communicate. The most visible skill a staff officer possess is that of \ncommunication. The best plans and ideas will matter little if poorly communicated. S imilarly, \nthe best presenter or writer will be unable to ‘sell’ a poorly thought through plan.    \n6.3. If your communication is going to be worth the effort, then it must be effective. What \ndo we mean by Effective Communication? Put simply:  \n• ‘Effective Communication is defined as the ability to convey information to \nanother effectively and efficiently. ’  \nIf the communication is effective, it will have met its purpose, have been clearly understood \nand can be acted upon. If it is efficient, it will make best use of your time and the time of the \naudience. As the originator, this responsibility lies with you.  It is a process about knowing \nwhat is required, finding, and gathering the information to meet the requirement and then \nconveying the information clearly and simply. It is much more than just exchanging \ninformation.  \n6.4. Communication comes in many forms: it could be a presentation to an audience to \ninform; it could be a written briefing to senior officer to seek a decision; it may be a briefing \nfrom a flipchart to explain, and there are many other examples.  \n6.5. For any type of communication, we should always apply the POWER principle:  \n• Plan. \n• Organise . \n• Write. \n• Edit. \n• Review/Rehearse . \nPlan .  (See Planning Sheet at below  which you should use to aid planning ) \n6.6. Timings .  The first thing we must do is establish how much time we have.  First \nestablish by when, date and time, the requirement is due. When you have a total time break \nthis time down into thirds:  \n• 1/3 of the time to Plan  and Organise ,  \n• 1/3 to Write  and  \n• 1/3 to Edit and Review/Rehearse . \n• You also need to know for a verbal brief/presentation, how long have you got to \nspeak for and is there a questions and answer session too.  \n6.7. Planning Questions .  To understand what the requirement is, some important \nquestions need to be answered. Use the 5W and H method:  \n• When? – see above which you have now answered!  \n• Where? - If a presentation or a verbal brief, where do you have to be? If a piece \nof written communication, who does it need to be with?  \n• What? – What do they want to know? Have you been asked any questions?  \n• Why? - Why do they want to know? What are they going to do with the \ninformation?  \nSERIAL 3-04-06 \n3–04–06 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20 • Who? Who is the communication for? Who are the audience? What does the \naudience already know?  \n• How? What are your initial thoughts on headings/sections/ideas/topics, etc.  \n6.8. Organise .  After planning you now need to organise your thoughts and your \nreference material. If you have references or source information read these through and \nidentify which parts are helpful to meeting the purpose of the task, which parts provide \ninformation w ithin the key headings.  Which information provides answers to any questions \nyou have been asked. You will have more information that you need. You will not be able to \ncover everything so you must decide what to include and what not! The choice can  be \nhelped by categorising information by applying the MOSCOW  principle:  \n• Musts : these items must be included, without which the audience cannot \nunderstand what your communication is about.  (These are the few things you \nwould tell them if you had only two minutes to make them understand.)   \n• Shoulds : they really ought to know these things if they need to understand the \nsubject properly.  \n• Coulds : these are nice to know but can be left out and, if your audience is for a \nsenior officer, they should always be left out.  \n• Will Nots : information that may be relevant to the topic but does not meet the \npurpose of the communication identified in the planning.  \nCross reference the list of Must, Should, Coulds and Will Nots with the available reference \nmaterial to meet your purpose. Identify a logical structure which meets the requirement – the \nquestions answered in the plan. This should present the identified Mus t and Should \ninformation in a way which will make sense to the audience. Present the most important \ninformation first - if there is more than one Must or Should arrange them by importance. Only \nafter you have Planned and Organised  should you start to write . \n6.9. Write .  In Writing  the detail is added to the structure developed during Planning  and \nOrganisation . With a piece of written communication start to draft the paragraphs under the \nstructure you have developed. With a verbal brief or presentation, always develop the points \nyou are going to talk about before you start to consider how you will illustrate th em. Do not  \nbe tempted to start to design slides or a briefing aid before you have understood the points \nyou are going to make. All types of communication should have a Beginning, Middle and \nEnd. This is a standard convention and the audience you are commun icating will be \nexpecting the information to come in these three parts.  \n• The beginning .  This  should explain what the communication is about and \ndefine its purpose. The audience need this made clear to them. The audience \nshould understand what will follow and also why they should be listening to you \nor reading your document in the first place.  \n• The middle  details the main points you wish to cover – your Musts and Shoulds. \nMake your most important points first. Within each heading or section make your \nmost important point first too.  \n• The end should convey your key message again. But it may also convey where \nto go from here, what next.  \n• Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity . In general,  when you communicate, whether \nwritten or verbal, it should follow the convention of Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity \nor A B C:  \n• Accuracy  - the information given must be reliable, and you must take care to \ndistinguish fact from opinion.  \nSERIAL 3-04-06 \n3–04–06 - 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20 •Brevity .  Focus on the key points identified from your Musts and Shoulds.\nThose who you are providing the communication for, usually senior officers, will\nnot have time to read long documents or sit through long presentations.\n•Clarity .  Use simple language presenting the material as clearly as possible.\nUse language and structure to allow for quick understanding. Your audience\nshould be able to understand the first time they read or hear a presentation.\n• Language .  To enhance A B C – choose your language carefully. Choose clear,\neveryday words in simple sentence structures within short paragraphs,\nappropriate for the audience. Use correct, spoken English or Arabic and avoid\ntechnical language, jargon, acronyms, abbre viations, abstractions and\nmeaningless corporate -speak. Often one carefully chosen word can do the job of\na phrase, or a phrase can replace a sentence. We communicate clearly because\nwe think clearly, and we think clearly because we communicate clearly.  C lear,\nprecise language not only helps us to communicate, but it also ensures that\nwe’ve got our own thinking properly sorted out.  Vague statements such as\n‘issues around’ hide muddled thinking and communicate an imprecise message.\nWe must think matters t hrough to make sure we’re saying exactly what we\nmean. For example, how much more informative are phrases such as will\nincrease, will damage, will reduce, will complicate than is the widely used ‘will\nimpact’ upon?\n• Question as you Draft . As we write, it’s helpful to imagine a sceptical senior\nofficer or audience repeatedly asking us two simple questions: Says who?  So\nwhat?  The first reminds us to present some convincing and punchy evidence to\nsupport our arguments.  The second forces u s to pursue the logic of what we’re\nsaying through to a precise and concrete conclusion, often revealing the solid,\npractical advantage of our recommendation.\n6.10. Edit.  There is always a temptation to steal some of the last 1/3 of the time available \n–which should be used for Editing , Reviewing and Rehearsing, to assist with writing. Be\ndisciplined. Protect the last 1/3 of your time, it will improve the quality of your product no end.\nA senior officer can always tell if you have not left enough time to first Edit and then\nReview/Rehears e your work. Editing is a distinct phase of the process – it focuses on the\ncontent . It provides that opportunity to ensure the poin ts made are as concise and precise as\npossible.\n• Check MOSCOW .  Stand -back from the detailed process of writing and take a\nfresh look at the content. Look at the Must and Should information again. Now\nthe words are drafted do these bits of information remain Musts and Shoulds? If\nnot, re -order them accordingly and b e ruthless.\n• Review A, B, C .\n•Accuracy  – ensure the information is factually accurate. Leave out any\ninformation that you are not sure about, or if it is critical, confirm that information\nbefore including it. It is OK not to know something but to communicate\ninformation that is plain wrong is  inexcusable.\n•Brevity  – ensure every word is required to communicate the points made . Go\nthrough each line and check that the words used are necessary. Remove those\nwords that add no value.\n•Clarity  – check the words convey the intended meaning. Keep the language\nsimple and the sentences short and to the point. Put yourself in the audience’s\nposition – is it clear?\nSERIAL 3-04-06 \n3–04–06 - 4 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20 At the end of the editing process, you will have improved the quality of your work. You \nwill have improved not just the language but the sense and understand. This is time \nwell spent and will add value to any communication you are drafting.  \n6.11. Review/Rehearse .  The final part of preparation is to Review and Rehearse .\nEditing looks specifically at what is said and written. Reviewing is different. \n• Review  looks at whether the intended purpose has been met. To review, go\nback to the key questions you asked in the planning phase and check against\nthese:\n•Who?  - Who is the communication for? What do they know already? Have\nyou made allowances for what the audience knows already – don’t repeat what\nthey already know.\n•Why?  - Why do they want to know – what is the purpose? Does what you\nhave prepared meet the overall purpose? What is the senior officer intending to\ndo with the information? Is what you have prepared useful to the senior officer\nbased on the purpose?\n•What?  - What do they want to know? If they have asked you specific\nquestions – have you answered them ? If they have asked you for an opinion –\nhave you given it and is it clear it is your opinion and not fact?\nBy taking time to review, you are confirming you have met the key criteria you have \nbeen asked to produce. You should have confidence to know that you have met the \nkey requirements. Don’t ever overlook reviewing your work.  \n• Rehearsal . If delivering a verbal communication,  you will have to rehearse. If a\npresentation you should book time and a space to rehearse. If it is a briefing for a\nsenior officer, as a staff officer, you may not be able to rehearse away from your\ndesk. That does not matter, if you must, rehearse at yo ur desk. Even if you get to\nrehearse just once, it will be worth it. Use the opportunity to align what you are\ngoing to say to any briefing aids you may use, maps, diagrams etc and ensure\nyou stick to the tim e you have got. Use some of the rehearsal time to run through\nyour responses to questions you may receive – just two or three of the most\nlikely will do.\n• Answering Questions .  Different types of communication require different ways\nto answer questions.\n•Presentations . When giving a presentation to an audience a useful way to\nanswer questions is:\n•Stand still – walking around reduces confidence in the answer.\n•Actively Listen - look at the person who posed the question.\n•Paraphrase the question so all can hear.\n•Thank the asker.\n•Handle the question – give a concise answer.\n•Verify with the asker you have answered their question.\n•Verbal Brief . After delivering a verbal briefing a focussed way to provide a\nuseful answer is:  What – So What – Now What\n•What  – answer the question posed.\n•So What  – what was the outcome, what happened because of the\nanswer to the question.\n•Now What  – what does this all mean for the future.\nSERIAL 3-04-06 \n3–04–06 - 5 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20 6.12.  Key Points : \n• For any type of communication to any type of audience – use P O W E R  to\nmake your communication more effective.\n• After you have determined when the information is due (and where), allow 1/3 of\nthe time to plan and organise, 1/3 to write and 1/3 to edit and review/rehearse.\n• When Planning:\n•Apply the 5W an H .\n•Ask yourself  some key questions – What information do they want to know?\nWho wants it? What are they going to do with it? Who are the audience? And\nwhat do they already know?\n• When Organising:\n•Prioritise your information using the MOSCOW  principle:\n•Retain the Musts and Shoulds – don’t include the Coulds.\n•Present your most important  points first.\n• When Writing:\noEvery communication needs a Beginning, Middle and End.\noEnsure what you write is Accurate, Brief and Clear.\noSelect the appropriate language  for the audience.\n• When Editing:\noFocus on the content:\n•Edit for MOSCOW ; are the Musts and Shoulds in the right place still?\n•Edit for A B C  – reduce your words down to what is the minimum\nrequired to be effective.\n• When Reviewing/Rehearsing:\noReview what you have written against the key questions from your planning –\nhave you met the purpose?\noIf a verbal brief or presentation – rehearse.\noIf you are expecting questions think about you could be asked and think about\nanswers.\n6.13. Written Brief Format – IRTB.   If writing a written brief as part of the Write \nelement of POWER,  a useful format to present information to a senior officer is the IRTB \nformat or Issue, Recommendation, Timing and Background.  IRTB describes the key \nheadings of the written brief.  All the content under each heading will have been identified \nin the Plan and Organise parts of POWER before the Write element. The IRTB format \nshould be used as described below: \na. Beginning .  The beginning contains the Title of the document and the Issue.\nThe Title should cover the theme of the brief and should not be the same as the\nIssue.  The Issue is very specific  it is a short sentence to present the Issue to the\nreader:\nIf the written brief is to inform the Issue should be phrased:  \n‘To inform you, To update you  on the …[here insert to Issue] .’ \nSERIAL 3-04-06 \n3–04–06 - 6 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 20 20 If the written brief is seeking a decision from the reader then the Issue should be \nphrased:  \n‘Whether/ Which [insert organisation or person] could/should [insert action for \nwhich decision is being sought].  \nb. Middle .   The middle of the written brief cover the Recommendations, Timing\nand Background.\n•Reco mmendations .   Th e recommendation (s) are put in a s the very next\nheading , it is effectively a BLUF, which recommends to the reader what to do.\nThis is important , as the reader understand s from the very start what you are\nasking them to do.  They  can read the rest of the brief with the\nrecommendations in mind.   The Recommendations paragraph is written as\nfollows:\nRecommendations .   [Insert appointment of the person you are writing \nthe brief for ] is requested to:  \na.Note. [State the current situation around the issue  – this is drawn\nfrom your analysis in the Background p aragraphs]\nb.Agree. [If you are seeking a decision include the decision you are\nseeking  - if there is no decision remove this paragraph]\n•Timing .   You must indicate to the reader how long they have to make a\ndecision .  This is expressed a s one word, followed by an explanation of the\nimportance of the timing.   The timing is  either : Urgent  (if a decision is required\nthat day); Priority (if a decision is needed in 3 working days) ; Routine (if\nlonger than 3 days).  For example :\nTiming .  Priority .  A decision is required by tomorrow in time for the \nBoard meeting  the following day . \n•Background .   The Background paragraph is normal ly a number of separate\nparagraphs  and sub paragraphs  which contain key information about the\nissue and what factors have led to your recommendation.  Only include the\nMusts and Shoulds.  If seeking a decision, identify problems, solutions and\nthe factual  basis for action.  Here you should include arguments for and\nagainst courses of action.\nc. End.

This is often referred to as a ‘Handrail’ .  It is usuall y on one-side \nof A4, it contains the BLUF in a box at the top and a series of boxe s which contai n the \nansw ers to the seni or officer’s questions , one for each question.

The Oncoming Staff Brief is designed to ensure that all\nrelevant information is passed between staff on shift change.\n• CONOPS Brief . The CONOPS Brief is delivered by the staff or a commander (to\nhis superior) and outlines a COA using the principal headings of an OpO. It\nencompasses elements of both a Decision and Information Brief - the superior\ncommander may approve or reject the CON OPS, or seek further clarification. It\nalso allows for the opportunity to request additional resources.\n• Ops Room Visitor Brief . This situation brief is intended for briefing of visitors to a\nHQ or ops room.\n• Ops Update Brief . The Ops Update Brief is a brief given mid -operation to ensure\nSituational Awareness is maintained within the staff cells of a HQ.\n• Storyboard . Storyboards are usually a post -incident analysis tool which pictorially\nrepresents an event in time and space.

What is an Orders Group (O GROUP) ?  An Orders Group is the method a \ncommander uses to give oral (spoken) orders to his subordinates.  Commanders will usually \nprefer to issue orders in person so that they can impose their will and personality on their \nsubordinates, emphasise key points and allow subordinates to ask any questions \nimmediately.   It is usual for attendees at verbal O Groups to receive printed OSW and traces \nfrom the Higher HQ.   \n7.2. Rehearsals.  An orders group is a stage managed affair. Therefore a rehearsal is \ndesirable if not always practical.  \n7.3. Reception Arrangements. The bigger the headquarters , the more important the \nreception arrangements for those attending the O Gp. In particular consider:  \n• Arrangements for arrivals from outside the headquarters, including guidance on \nwhere to  park and how to get to the O Gp.  \n• Reception arrangements at the O Gp site. For example:  \no When those attending will be allowed access to the site.  \no Arrangements to meet early arrivals.  \no A location for copying of traces and marking maps, and for subordinates to \nread written  orders prior to receipt of oral orders. Ideally the HQ will already \nhave prepared traces and OSW for subordinates.  \n7.4. Requirements of Those Attending.  Consider the requirements of those attending \nthe O Gp. In particular:  \n• Where personal equipment can be stowed during their time at the headquarters.  \n• Drinks and meals.  \n• Communication facilities.  \n7.5. Seating Plan.  Although the commander may have his own views on where specific \nindividuals are to sit, the general principle is for the main subordinate commanders to sit \ncentrally at the front while other individuals, including the staff, sit at the sides. Considerat ion \nshould be given to:  \n• The availability, number and marking of seats:  \n• Displaying a seating plan.  \n7.6. Aids .  The aids used at an O Gp will vary. Consider the requirement for a marked \nmap, model or diagram, the need for documents, including confirmatory notes, task organisations and the use of PowerPoint (and the availability of reversionary methods should \npower  fail). \n7.7. Post O Gp.   After the O Gp staff cells may use the opportunity to amplify areas of the \norders with subordinate specialists who may have attended the O Gp with their commander  \neg the Engineer or Fires commander .  Staff should be careful not to use up the subordinates’ \n‘2/3’ of planning time in doing so.  Once subordinates have had sufficient time to plan, it is \nusual for them to backbrief  the commander on their plan and for the commander to host a \nROC drill.  \nSERIAL 3-04-07 \n3–04–07 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2– May 2020 7.8.

What is LOG KEEPING ?  The log is a record of all activities, all information received  \nand all decisions taken by the HQ.  This detail is recorded either electronically or on a log \nsheet.  All operational messages must be logged and acknowledged by a watchkeeper and the information passed to those concerned, both inside and outside the CP. Watchkeepers themselves must understand the commander’s intent and be able to analyse, interpret and \nact on information received.  \n8.2. Accurate Records .  The importance of accurate and comprehensive log -keeping \ncannot be overstressed; logs may be required for after action analysis and could be \nparticularly relevant in other operations.  The detail on the operations log should be \ncirculated within the CP at formation level and above.  The need for a hard copy of the log to \nbe passed around a CP will be reduced as more information is stored digitally. The following items should be included in the log:  \n•The gist of all radio and telephone conversations, with exact local time and date\ngroup.\n•All written messages and reports (hard copy only), both in and out of the HQ.  A l\nong\nm\nessage may be paraphrased or referred to by file reference and subject.\n•Reports from LOs and visitors and any other relevant information received.\n•The time of issue of OSW, and the times of dispersal of conferences and orders\ngroups.\n•The movements of the commander and senior staff officers.\n•Own or enemy action. Items to be included in SITREPs and the commander’s diaryto be written up effectively from the log.\n•Any other significant action such as those of non- military agencies.\nThe bare facts of events recorded in the log can be obscure to a reader unless they are in close touch with the situation. Time and mental effort can be saved by recording ‘comment’ in the action column of the log to underline the significance of a particular item and by \nmarking up items which are likely to be included in the compilation of OWNSITREPs or \nCOMBATREPs.  \n8.3. What are Reports & R eturns (R2) ?  Reports and Returns are the routine flow of \ninformation up and down the chain of command, normally tied to the battle rhythm and \ninformation requirements that have  been established to support the particular \noperation/campaign.  There is no standard R2 battle rhythm across Defence or NATO.  The format of reports will be set out in the HQ Standard Operating Instructions.  \n8.4.

The Campaign Plan : describes the nature of the crises from both strategic and \noperational level perspectives; sets out the strategic intent for the campaign; and provides \nthe Joint Task Force Commander’s (JTFC’s) intent in terms of what is to be achieved in \norder to succes sfully reach the campaign end- state. The Campaign Plan  is ‘owned’ by the \nJTFC although it will be influenced by others, particularly the Joint Commander (Jt Comd) \nand the Military Strategic Commander. It is the core document from which should stem all \nsubs equent planning and execution by the Joint Force.  \n2. The Campaign Plan  provides the JTFC’s Concept of Operations (CONOPS); this is \nfounded on those decisive conditions deemed necessary to achieving the campaign \nobjectives. Subsequent Operation Plans (OPLANs) and Joint Coordination Orders (JCO) (A \nJCO is a Joint Operation Orders(OPORDs) ) will address the supporting effects and activities \n(missions, tasks and purposes) that are required to achieve each of the decisive conditions.  \n3. In short duration campaigns, the JTFC may replace this  Campaign PLAN CONOPS  \nwith an OPLAN.  \nSITUATION  \n[This section is derived from Step 1 of the Operational Estimate –  Analysis products may be \nincluded as Annexes].  \n4.

C odewords .\na. It is not nec to incl here, or in a codewords annex, codewords given in a dml annex.\nb. Codewords for which there is a cont need, as opposed to those specific to the op covered \nby the opO, should be incl in the CEI and not in the opO.  Thus codewords for the con of STAP \nstages and EMCON should be given in the CEI.\nc\n.List in chronological sequence of use.\nd. Codewords are issued to fmns by MOD for use when required and are not to be invented \nlocally.  Once used they may not be repeated.\ne. To prevent repetition on different radio nets, lower fmns select different words from own \nlists for meanings which they require in their own orders.  Exception to this rule is for res dmls, \nwhere the same words are used at all levels of comd to avoid confusion when auth is delegated.  \n29. A cknowledgement .  It is normally desirable to require acknowledgement of an opO.  It may \nbe nec to specify which fmns and units are to acknowledge.\n30. S ignature Block .  The signature block is to be that of either the comd or his principal SO auth \nto sign for the  comd (COS), showing appt in each case.  The original copy of the order is to be \nsigned by comd or his COS as fol:\n............  or ...............  \nMaj Gen   Col \nComd 1 (UK) Armd Div  f or Comd 1 (UK) Armd Div  \nIf comd  or COS signs a master copy, use of which permits automatic repro of doc with signature \nthereon, no authentication is required.  If signature is not repro, authentication by the appropriate SO \nis required (see Note 31).  \nSERIAL 3-06-02 \n \n \n3-06-02 - 9 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \nAuthentication: (31)      B TURNER  \n       Maj \n       SO2 G3(Ops/O&D)  \n \nAnnexes: (32) (35)  \n \n A.

Authentication .  If neither comd or COS are aval to sign the opO at the time of issue, comd’s name \nis typed and a SO authenticates order, comd or COS signing original/file copy of opO at earliest \nopportunity.  In this case neither comd nor COS were aval so opO has been authenticated and comd \nwould sign file copy on return.  Had the COS been aval, no authentication would be nec, and he would \nsign for comd using his own signature block.  \n \n32. Annexes .  Annexes are lettered alphabetically in capitals, A, B, C etc and may have one or more \nappx numbered in arabic numerals.  Annexes must be referred to in appropriate part of  main body of  \nopO.  (see also Note 35).  \n \n33. Distr .  The distr is to show copy nos of order issued to each addressee.  Where annexes are issued \non a different scale from main body of order, a separate distr list will be required as part of each annex so \nissued.  \n \na. The list is set out in normal sequence external action addressees, external info addressees, \ninternal action addressees, internal info addressees.  The distr, taking into account ‘need to know’, \nshould incl:  \n \n (1) All fmns, unit or sub- units directly subordinate to originating comd.  \n \n (2) Each sp arms/svc organic to, sp of originating HQ.  \n  (3) RN/RAF units coop.  \n \n (4) Higher fmns, flanking fmns.  \n \n (5) Own comd and staff, file, comd’s diary and spare.  \n \nb. Copies for sp arms and svcs are addressed to that arm or svc, eg ‘Comms’, when a sp arm \nadviser, head of svc or svc rep is organic, or permanently att to originating HQ.  If no such rep exists \ncopies are addressed to appropriate arm or svc units.  Senio r comd or rep of each sp arm/svc is \nresponsible for distr to all elms of his arm/svc as nec.  \n \n34. Notes on Example . \n \na. Nos of Copies .  Sufficient copies should be given to avoid unnec repro by subordinate HQs, \neg bdes, Arty, Engr and Comms have 2 copies each (one for Step Up).  Bdes, Arty and Engr will \nproduce opOs of their own and there is little pt in giving them copies for each unit.  Some addressees \nmay need ext ra copies of particular annexes, eg  Mov Table for Pro.  Nevertheless, distr of whole \norder, and of individual annexes, should be kept to a sensible min, eg all addressees would not need \nAnnexes D and E (but see Note 34c).  \n \nb. PCS.  Although rep at Div HQ, PCS will receive detail they need from G1/G4 staff and do not \nneed full opO.  \n \nc. Distr of Annexes .  Annex C is ‘to fol’ and Annexes D and E have a different distr to main opO.  \nAll 3 annexes will therefore need to be made out as separate docs with their own separate distr.  \n \n \nSERIAL 3-06-02 \n \n \n3-06-02 - 10 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \nInternal:  \n \nAction:  \n \nStep Up HQ  12 \nRear HQ  13 \nArty 14-15 \nEngr  16-17 \nComms  18-19 \nAvn 20 \nLog Sp  21 \nMed 22 \nES 25 \nG1/G4  26 \nG2/G3  27 \nG3 (Air)  28 \n \nInfo: \n \nComd  29 \nFile 30 \nComd’s Diary  31 \nSpare 32-34 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 of 10  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSERIAL 3-06-02 \n \n \n3-06-02 - 11 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \n       ANNEX A TO \n       OPS 13  \n       DATED    JAN 1 X \n \nNICKNAMES  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA1 of 1  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n  \n  \n35.

An annex may take form of a trace, overlay, overprinted map, sketch, plan or table.  \n \nc. Annexes issued with, and in same no as main order, need only be suitably ident in \nrespect of the main order.  They must also contain a protective marking.  \n \nd. Annexes issued at different times from main order must also contain their own \nsuperscription and subscription, incl acknowledgement instrs and a signature.  \n \ne. An int annex to an opO will fol a more rigid format than other annexes and may be \nissued before opO is distr.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSERIAL 3-06-03 \n3–06–03 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 LAND OV ERLAY OPERATION ORDER (Over lay OPORD or OpO)  \n3.1. Introduction .  Overlay O rders  are the combination of written and graphic instructions \non one trace containing enough info for a commander to carry out his specified tasks.  \n3.2. General .  When producing an overlay OpO the maximum amount of information \nshould be represented graphically.  The recipient of an order should be able to place the \ntrace onto his map and then ‘fight’ from it.  The temptation to produce too much information \nmust b e resisted.  The following are only guidelines as production of an overlay OpO \nultimately entails subjective judgement by author.  Overlays may be produced electronically  \non command systems , as ‘clears’, with or without a map background (‘taciprint’ ) or on paper.  \n3.3. General Rules . \na. The author must be free to put on overlay what he deems necessary.  The \noverlay should show the situation as commander intends/expects it to be when the \noperation is carried out rather than current situation. The difference between ‘actual’ \nand ‘projected’  dispositions must be made clear.  \nb. The order may be issued by any suitable method.  \nc. The written part of order must follow the same sequence as formal written orders \nand can be produced in manuscript.  \nd. The requirements of speed normally dictate that overlays are handwritten and in \nonly one colour.  With increased use of digital networks, a combination of typewritten \ntext and handwritten or computer -generated graphics may prove a useful alternative \nprovided speed is not sacrificed.  \ne. A logical way to proceed is to complete graphical overlay first.  It is then easy to \nsee what must be included, in addition to the required sections, in the written portion of \nthe order either because it has proved difficult to portray or it will cause too much \nclutter on overlay.  \n3.4. The Overlay .  The completed overlay should be a distillation of all information \navailable to the commander when carrying out the specific task.  Those points which cannot \nreadily be transposed to graphics or which would obscure either map or trace detail should \nbe wr itten at the side.  Some particular points to note are:  \na. Task Organisation .  Shown diagrammatically anywhere on the overlay.  The ‘No \nchanges except’ method should be used if possible.   \nb. Enemy.  Information may be given on the overlay, on a separate overlay or by \nreference to other documents such as INTSUMs.  Information which cannot be \ndepicted should be written down.  \nc. Friendly Forces .  Information concerning friendly forces other than those \ncovered by the order, but which affects action of subordinate commanders, can either \nbe drawn on overlay or stated in the written portion.   \nd. Mission.  Originator’s mission must always be stated in writing.  \ne. Colon.  \n(1) A colon (:) indicates that detail relevant to subject is included in the \ngraphics.  This could mean additional information or repetition of detail given in \ntext. \n(2) The colon should appear at the end of the paragraph or sub paragraph \nheading to indicate detail is included in graphics; a colon would never appear \nhere under normal rules.  If a colon appears at end of text it indicates the \nintroduction of a list.  \nSERIAL 3-06-03 \n3–06–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 f. Mandatory Text .  The mission, concept of operations and subordinates’ missions\nmust be included in the text.\ng. Subordinates’ Missions/Tasks.  Subordinate formations and units will always\nbe listed whether or not info applicable to them is shown in writing or on the trace.\nh. Coordinating Instructions.  Key timings and grid references (e.g.: locations of\nminefield gaps) should be listed if not immediately obvious or emphasised on overlay.i. Service Support .  The service support organisation may be shown on\n a\ns\neparate overlay or in a written annex.\nj. HQ.  Instructions concerning locations and movement of  HQ will usually be giv en\non ov\nerlay.\nk. Symbols.  Symbols other than those given in STANAG 2019 may be used;\nwhere necessary these should be explained in a legend.\n3.5. Despatching the Order .  Apart from using liaison officers or couriers, means of \ndistributing orders are changing with the advent of new technology such as CIS. \n3.6. Summary .  The aim of an overlay OpO is to provide a quick set of simple orders \noutlining a commander’s concept of operations and missions for his subordinate \ncommanders.  The shorter time from warning order to despatch the more likely the operation \nis to be a success.  Simplicity and speed will enhance security.  \n3.7. Example.  Example of overlay order is below .  Note example is only shown on 2 \npages for ease of reproduction in the SOHB.  Spacing between lines has been compressed \n(as it would be for real) to reduce size.  \nSERIAL 3-06-03 \n  3-06-03 - 3  EXAMPLE OF A LAND OVERLAY OPO (DIV)  \n \n \n          \n \n   \n  \n1.

FRAGOs are an abbreviated form of opO.  They may be used in 3 ways:  \n• To issue timely changes to existing orders.  This is the most commonly used form \nof a FRAGO.  \n• To issue key sects of an order before the complete order has been produced.  \n• To provide specific instructions to command ers who do not require the complete \norder.  \n4.2. The standard OpO sequence and paragraph headings are used.  However, after the \nheadings, parts of the order which are unchanged or not essential are omitted.  In a FRAGO \nissued to amend existing orders it will be usual for the mission  to remain unchanged but for \nthe subordinates’ tasks to be amended to reflect new developments in the situation .  If the \nsituation has changed to the extent that the mission  has changed the issue of a FRAGO \nwould be inappropriate and a new OpO should be issued.  \n4.3. Gen written FRAGOs should fol low the normal conventions of operational  SD and the \nrules governing the production of OpOs/overlay OpOs.  There are 2 exceptions:  \n• The superscription of a schematic FRAGO can fol any reasonable format (see \nexample at Serial 14.  \n• The text of a FRAGO disseminated by sig should be in capitals throughout.  \n4.4. FRAGOs can be issued in schematic rather than overlay form to allow the order to be \nproduced in A4 size.  This facilitates transmission by fax.  Alternatively, electronic mail (E -\nMail) may be used.  \n4.5. In the examples that fol low, distribution lists have been cut short to save space.  \nSERIAL 3-06-04 \n3–06–04 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 DTG:  211400C FEB 11  \nFROM:  7 ARMD BDE MAIN  \nTO:  SCOTS DG  \n  1 RRF \n  4 REGT AAC  \nINFO: 1 (UK) ARMD DIV MAIN  \n  4 ARMD BDE MAIN  \nOPS 13  \nFRAGO 3/9X: CHANGE TO OPO 5/9X  \nTask Org:  SCOTS DG   (3,1) OPCON 7 BDE    from 4 BDE    WEF 242100C  until 271200C . \n   4 Regt AAC ( -) OPCON 7 BDE    from 1  DIV   WEF 250200C  until  260800 C. \n1.

Under comd for daily maint (UCDM).  \n \n(4) Comd Responsibility .  The state of comd, both op comd and admin \ncomd, must be shown for log units but only admin comd status will usually be \nnec for other non-log units.  These log units are listed in the precedence of their \nstate of op comd and, within these categories, by their state of admin comd.  \nState of op comd takes precedence over state of admin comd eg: OPCOM and UCDM, OPCON and UCADMIN, TACON and UCDM.  \n \n(5) Residual Responsibility for Dets.  The op/admin states shown for dets \nis the status passed to another unit/fmn.  The residual responsibility remains with the parent fmn; eg had 110 Sqn RLC(V) been OPCOM and UCADMIN \n1(UK) Div, the det of one tp to TACON and UCDM ARRC would still leave 1(U K) \nDiv responsible for all admin matters less daily maint of that det tp.  \n \n(6) States of Comd .  As already mentioned the state of comd of a log unit \nmust show both op and admin responsibilities.  This para is concerned solely \nwith the various degrees of admin comd, which are:  \n \n(a) UCADMIN.  Complete transfer of admin comd; when a fmn or unit \nis placed under comd of another fmn for admin, ie all svcs, med and pers \nmatters.  In this instance the fmn/unit’s parent fmn HQ has no residual \nadmin responsibility.  \n \n(b) UCADMIN Less .  When the temporary nature of the transfer \nmakes it unnec to eff a complete  change of admin comd, a fmn or unit \nmay be placed under comd for certain specified matters, or UCADMIN less \ncertain specified matters, eg UCADMIN less sup and routine G1 matters  \nfrom 191000 Jan.  (NB ‘Less sup’ does not affect sup responsibility for \ndaily maint as defined below.)  \n (c) UCDM .  When a fmn or unit is transferred for so short a time that it \nis placed under admin comd of the new fmn for daily maint only, its parent \nfmn HQ retains full responsibility for all other admin matters.  (Units det to \nanother fmn assumed to be UCDM their new fmn unless otherwise stated).  \n \n  \nSERIAL  3-06-05 \n3-06-05 - 5 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020  \nPROTECTIVE MARKING  \n \n2.

Times at which states are \neff will not nec be the same as an opO and its related CSSO (eg, if the CSSO \nwere produced significantly later than the opO, a unit which came ‘under  \nOPCOM forthwith’ in the opO might be ‘remaining UCADMIN’ in the CSSO).  \nNor is it always desirable for admin comd to change at the same time as op \ncomd.  Ideally admin comd should change during quiet periods in the replen \ncycle and therefore as a principle ni would be a bad time.  \n \n(9) OpO.  Units may sometimes be mentioned in the ‘Atts and Dets’ sub para \nof a CSSO, although they did not appear in the opO.  This is because the sub \npara is concerned only with admin atts and dets, and responsibility for admin is \nnot necessarily linked directl y with op comd.  \n \nb. Changes in Admin Comd . \n \n(1) It is not nec to show changes here if they are covered under ‘Log Task \nOrg’, but they should be incl if this is considered to help the clarity of the order.  \n \n(2) Only changes to existing admin arrangements at the level of the fmn \ninitiating the CSSO are incl, eg in a div CSSO  there is no need to mention the switching of a BG between bdes within the div, but a TA bn to the div changing \nfrom UCDM 1(UK) Div to UCADMIN 1(UK) Div would be.  \n \n11. Msn.  This is a statement of the admin aim.  If possible it should show the phase of \nops or period covered by the order, however lack of time will probably preclude the \nproduction of separate CSSOs for separate phases.  \n \n12. Gen.  Give the outline of admin plan incl a log task org and admin tfc circulation plan \n(which may be issued as an overlay).  It should include an admin/log ‘Concept of Ops’ sub para which compares with the equivalent sub para in an opO and might incl such pts as:  \n \n a. Overall log plan.  \n \nb. Log Task Org .  The Log Task Org only needs to show changes to op and admin \ncomd status of log units and changes in admin comd of others.

If no such permanent rep exists copies are addressed to\nthe appropriate  arm or svc units.

Sufficient copies should be  given to avoid unnec repro by\nsubordinate HQs, eg bdes and Comms have 2 copies each (one for Step Up) whileArty have enough to issue copies to regts under comd.  Some addressees may als\no\nneed ex\ntra copies of particular annexes: Log Sp, Med and ES will require addl copies\nfor each sub unit.  Nevertheless, distr of the whole order, and of individual annexes,should be kept to a sensible min.\nb. P\nro.  Pro at div level is DAPM.\nc\n.PCS.

All suc h\nannex\nes would therefore need to fol the full form.\n SERIAL 3-06-06 \n3–06–06 - 1 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 TASK ORGANISATION (TASKORG)   \n6.1. Conventions.  The grouping of forces for specific operations or phases within operations is \ndescribed by a Task Organisation (TaskOrg).  \na. The aim of graphical task organisation should be to produce a clear, logical and \nunambiguous picture of formations , units  or task specific groupings and their respective states \nof co mmand for an operation or phase of an operation.  For clarity a separate full or \nabbreviated task organisation may be nec essary for each phase of an operation,  when \nregrouping takes place.  \nb. The system is best equated to double entry book -keeping, where entries are made both \nin the credit and debit sect ions, in that changes to units  are shown in the attachments  and \ndetachments  columns.  \nc. Regardless of the template you use, the following  information  should be displayed in the \ncolumns:  \n(1) Level of command in the title box at the head of each column.  \n(2) Manoeuvre units operate under a level of com mand  and state of command  of \neach individual unit in main sect of column.  \n(3) Units are detached  from a level of comd in ( -) sect of column.  \n6.2. Display.  Task Org is displayed in columns.  Each column is headed by the symbol of a \nformation or unit immediately subordinate to the originator (ie a division  operation order  is in brigade \ncolumns, a brigade operation order  is in regimental , battalion or battle group columns).  Troo ps \nallocated special tasks ( reserves , rear area security , guard , screen, etc) are usually listed under a \ncolumn headed ‘Special Tasks’.   However,  where such a task is to be carried out by one of the \nmanoeuvre units  or formatio ns, it may remain in the main body of the task org rather than move to \n‘Special Tasks’ column. Troops  organic to originator ( division al troops , brigade troops ) are listed \nunder separate column, ‘Div Tps’ etc, but only changes to such troops  need be shown.  Blank \ncolumns may be left for the regrouping of formations  or units.  \n6.3. States of Comd.  Op comd takes precedence over admin comd.  Within columns all unit \nsymbols are gp in the order:  \nFULL COMD   ADCON \nOPCOM    ADCON less.... \nOPCON    LOGCON  \nTACOM     \nTACON    \n  \nAlthough operation order  task orgs usually only need to show operational  states of comd, both \noperational  and admin states should be shown if the admin state changes or if there is a need to \nclarify the sit, i.e.:  \n(1) OPCOM and ADCON   \n(2) OPCOM and ADCON less...  \n(3) OPCON and ADCON less...  \n(4) OPCON and ADCON  \n(5) TACON and ADCON  \n SERIAL 3-06-06 \n3–06–06 - 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.4. Precedence.  Precedence for listing in each state of comd is:  \nArmour in order of unit precedence within each arm but note that in a bde task org,  \nInfantry  The unit providing the B attle Group HQ is shown as the first entry in the main sect  of \nthe column, regardless of unit precedence.  \nCbt Sp  Artillery, Engineer, Communication, Helicopters  In order of size and, if of same size, \nin numerical order  \nCSS Logistics, Health Service  Support , Equipment Support, MP In order of size and, if of \nsame size, in numerical order  \n6.5. Field Indicator .  When the level of command  in a column is a b attle group, there are \ndifferent conventions on how to display the sub- units organic to that parent unit which are to remain \ngrouped with it.   \na. Option 1 . It is sufficient to repeat the regimen t or b attalio n symbol with the addition of a \nminus sign to reflect any det achments  to another com mand .  Only the size indicator field on \nthe column title symbol will be capped to rep resent  an all arms group ( battle group) . \nb. Option 2 .  List every sub -unit in the column as shown in the example below.  \n6.6. Detachments . \na. Where a symbol shows ( -), the detachment  is to be shown in the ( -) sect at the bottom of \neach column.  This rule applies to troops  organic to originator and to non- organic  troops who \nare then split up within the formation  they have come to support .  Non -organic troops  which \narrive already depleted to support  the formation should have their previous detachment  shown \nagainst the symbol in the main column.  \nb. When a formation  (eg brigade) is detached  from its parent formation  (eg Division ) only \nthe brigade HQ and its own Armour and Infantry  units are detached.  If artillery , engineer  or \nother units are also to be det this must be shown under ‘Div Tps’, unless they are themselves \norganic rather than affiliated.  \nc. Battlegrouping .1  The combat element of a combined arms group is described in terms \nof the number of subunits of each type it has under command, as follows and in the order of:  \n \n(1) Armour  \n(2) Infantry  \n(3) A combined arms grouping of : \n(a) 2 x Tank Companies  and 1 x Infantry Company is shown as (2, 1)  \n(b) 1 x Tank Company  and 3 x Infantry Companies  is shown as (1, 3)  \n   \n6.7. Special Tasks.  If a special task ( brigade Guard, divisional  reserve ) is based on 2 or more \nsubunits  of equal size, the command  must be nominated by name or appt and shown in the column.  \n6.8. Half Bars .  Half bars are normally only used in relation to the ‘Special Tasks’ columns to \nidentify separate states of command when there is more than one group or task  shown in a single \ncolumn.  They follow the rules of paragraph headings in non- op SD: once started they should \ncontinue to be used down to the next special task or level of command  which is then to be identified  \nwith a full bar.  \n \n1 Source is Planning and Execution Handbook Ch 8 dated Mar 23.  \n SERIAL 3-06-06 \n3–06–06 - 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.9.

The first output of the Joint Air Estimate is the Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP), also \nknown as the SUPLAN AIR in NATO doctrine. The JAOP is the air commander’s blueprint \nfor integrating and coordinating air activities. It should include;  plans to transition from initial \nto sustainment forces as appropriate; plans for conflict termination and the subsequent redeployment of forces; and procedures to be used to capture lessons.  \n1.2. The JAOP provides: \na. Objectives and tasks by priority, describing in which order they shoul d be\nac\ntioned, the desired effects and the weight of effort required.\nb. The measures or indicators of success that are to be used to determine whether\njoint air operations are meeting assigned objectives; accounting for current andpotential enemy offensive and defensive COA.\nc.

Analysis, planning and decision making in the Maritime environment follow similar \nprocesses, procedures and formats to those done at the higher tactical level in other \nenvironments.  The Maritime Component Commander (MCC) and his HQ staff will \nparticipate in the Joint Task Force Commander’s planning; contributing their  specialist \nmaritime knowledge to the process.  The MCC will also conduct his own estimate and planning process ; the output of which will be plans and orders for his  component (Task \nForce).  This will contain the missions and tasks for any subordinate task groups, task units \nand task elements.  \nMARITIME OPERATIONAL STAFF WORK (OSW)  \n1.2. The MCC uses the same common  ‘Plans and Orders ’ framework of OSW  as the \nother components.  Normally the MCC  will issue an OPLAN or OPORD in St ep 7; altered by \nthe issue of FRAGOs as required.  With modern communications these can be transmitted \nelectronically from shore to ship or ship to ship.  \nOPGEN - SIGNAL MESSAGE ORDERS  \n1.3. If time is short or communications degraded, orders may be issued using a formatted \nsignal message called an OPGEN .  \nSERIAL 3-09- 01 \n3–09– 01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT  (IRM) \n1.1. General . The staff’s role is to support the commander and the subordinate units and  \norganisations. The basis of the staff ’s role lies in generating, moving and packaging \ninformation such that it can be exploited by commanders and subordinates to make the right \ndecision.  \n1.2. Definitions : \na. Information Requirements Management  (IRM) .  The management of\ninformation regarding an adversary or potentially hostile actors and other relevant\naspects of the operational environment that needs to be collected and processed t o\nm\neet the intelligence requirements of a commander.\nb. Information Management (IM) . IM is a set of integrated management processes\nand services that enable and support the capability for collectors, producers and users\nto store,  locate, retrieve and transform information, allowing it to become the right\ninformation in the right form and of adequate quality to satisfy the demands of the\ncommander or  organisation.\nc. Information Exploitation (IX) . The sharing and use of information to support\nsituation awareness, planning and decision making and the coordination of desired\neffects.\n1.3. Information Management : The Basis of Decision Making. The chance of making \nthe right decision is increased with the fidelity and accuracy of the information on which that \ndecision will be based.  Information must therefore be accurate, unambiguous, concise, \nclear, consistent and timely.  The origins (provenance) and status (such as historic or \ncurrent, draft or final) of the information must be known and it should be in a form which is \naccessible and usable and stored and passed in a way that ensures it is protected. This requirement forms the basis of Information Management (IM).  \n1.4. Storing Information. Information must be stored in the right place, correctly labelled, \nso that found and used again. Staff need to be familiar with file structures, drives and \ndatabases, the methods of labelling information and be able to work collaboratively.  \n1.5. File Naming Convention \na. Format\n(1) Document and Record names must consist of three elements, separat ed\nby\n hyphens ( -):• Date -Title-Protective Marking\n(2) Only the following characters are normally allowed:  • A-Z, a-z, 0-9,\nhyphen, round brackets, space, underscore.\n(3) Where an application is unable to handle round brackets or spaces\nsatisfactorily, use underscores instead.(4) The three elements, consisting of mandatory (listed in BOL\nD\nU\nPPERCASE) and optional parts are described in the  paragraphs below.\nb. Date  - This must show when the version of the document was created or\namended. It consists of:\n(1) DATE  (in the format YYYYMMDD);\n(2) An UNDERSCORE - this is only required if a time is included;\n(3) TIME  (in the format HHMMZ, where Z is the appropriate Time Zone).\nc. Title - consists of the following parts, separated by single spaces:\n(1) DESCRIPTION - this should be meaningful but concise;\nSERIAL 3-09- 01 \n3–09– 01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 (2) DOCUMENT STATUS - this should be included where the status of t he\ndoc\nument is important or  requires clarification. Examples include `Draft’, `Under\nReview’, `Final’ and `Published’;\n(3) VERSION (in the format “vx_y” where x represents the major versi on\ni\ndentifier, and y the minor one - see Version Numbering, over) if required;\n(4) ORIGINATING UNIT or ROLE, if required;\n(5) FILE REFERENCE, if required.\nd. VERSION NUMBERING . • In order to track the status of a document the\nfollowing system should be used:\n(1) The major identifier is the number of the version promulgated (or, for\ndrafts, to be promulgated);(2) The minor identifier is numeric for live versions and alphabetic for draft\nversions. (To avoid confusion with 0, O is eliminated from the alphabetic\nsequence. Z is followed by AA, AZ by BA, etc.)\n(3) Examples\n(a) The first draft of a document is v1_A, and subsequent drafts ar\ne\nv\n1_B, v1_C.\n(b) The first live document is always v1_0.\n(c) Minor amendments for live are v1_1, v1_2, v1_3.\n(d) Drafts of the next major release are v2_A, v2_B, v2_C.\n1.6. Information Exploitation (IX) . Information exploitation is the staff’s usage and reuse \nof information that  has been gathered from across the information environment in order to \nprovide situational awareness or inform decisions.  \na. Collaborative Working . Collaborative working requires an iterative exchange of\ninformation which progressively adds value and deepens understanding. Staff work in\na virtual, not necessarily physical, location to produce a common output. Collaborative\nworking increases tempo and efficiency.\nb. Information Superiority . Information Superiority is the capability to collect,\nprocess, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while exploiting ordenying an adversary’s ability to do similarly. Two key elements which will assist in\nachieving information superiority are:\n(1) Search. Efficient labelling, logical storage and forensic weeding of out of\ndate information, coupled with good search tools will improve staff ability t\no\nr\netrieve the  right information. Further guidance on search is contained in IM\nProtocol 024.\n(2) Fusing and Presenting Information. Staff should consider how\ninformation should be fused, packaged and presented depending on the lengt h\nof\n preparation time and the prior knowledge of the person to whom it will  be\npas\nsed.\nSERIAL 3-10-01 \n3–10–01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 JOINT BATTLESPACE MANAGEMENT (B M) (AJP-3 Annex C) \n1.1. Battle space Management  (BM) :  Defined as: “ Battlespace management is the use \nof all necessary adaptive means and measures that enable the planned and dynamic \ncoordination, synchronization and prioritization of activities across all dimensions of an \nassigned area of operations within the battlespace,”  (AJP-3) .\n1.\n2. Battlespace : Defined as:  “The environment, factors and conditions that must be \nunderstood to apply combat power, protect a force or complete a mission successfully. ” \n(AJP-3)\nNote: It includes the land, maritime, air  and space domains ; the enemy and friendly forces \npresent therein; facilities; terrestrial and space weather; health hazards; terrain; the \nelectromagnetic spectrum; and the information environment in the joint operations area and \nother areas of interest.   \n1.3.  Purpose. Battlespace management applies at all levels of operations and enables \noperational level activities in cooperation with relevant non -NATO actors. Effective \nbattlespace management will ensure the appropriate allocation of three -dimensional space \nand the electromagnetic spectrum, over time, to various competing users, to maximize coordinated and synchronous operational effectiveness, while avoiding confusion leading to \na risk to the mission and/or the force.  \n1.4. Multi -domain Battlespace Management .  BM must be considered in the physical \nand non- physical battlespace across all domains and time.  Particular issues arise at seams \nand boundaries where the activities of different assets and capabilities within the joint force \ninteract with or impact others.  \n1.5. What is Battlespace Management ? Battle space management (BM) provides a \nnumber of tools and processes to help co -ordinate, synchronise and prioritise the military \nactivity throughout the Joint Task Force.  All the components involved in an operation will \nhave their initial battle- space conditions set by the JTFHQ. This will be promulgated in either \na discrete Joint Battlespace Management Instruction Document or a BM Annex to an OPLAN or OPORD.  BM is controlled by J3/5.  The purpose of BM is to maximise freedom of \naction / manoeuvre across domain boundaries  and to minimise constraints for all battle-\nspace users, while managing and reducing the risk of blue- on-blue.   \nFigure 1. 1Illustra tes the requirement for BM increases as component activity becomes more integrated  Enabling Battle -space Management\nLevel of Required InteractionIndependent\nComponent\n ActivitySynchronised\nComponent\n ActivityIntegrated\nComponent\n Activity\nSERIAL 3-10-01 \n3–10–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 1.\n6. BM Components: Joint Battle- space Management is divided into: \na. Physical Battlespace.\nb. Non-physical Battlespace.\n1.7. Physical Battlespace.  \na. Maritime BM :  Ma ritime BM consists of 4 aspects:\n(1) Water-space management,\n(2) Naval cooperation and guidance for shipping,\n(3) Amphibious operations,\n(4) Maritime  / land interface.\nb. Land BM :  Unlike Air and Maritime, Land BM is likely to require a combination of\nintegrated measures.  Each component commander will need battle- space to conduct\noperations. Land BM consists of 4 requirements:\n(1) Manoeuvre.\n(2) Air Defence (AD).\n(3) Airspace Control (ASC).\n(4) Fire Support Coord Measures (FSCM)\nc. Air BM  is known as Airspace Management (ASM) :  Routine ASM is delegat ed\nt\no a single Airspace Control Authority (ACA). The Air Component Commander (ACC)\nwill usually be the ACA for all airspace in the JOA / ASC -area.  All components have\nthe means for routine input to ASC through Airspace Control Means (ACM)\npromulgated through the Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Coordination Order (ACO)\nand Special Instructions (SPINS).\nd. Space BM . Space represents a domain in its own right, but also serves as  an\nenabl\ner for the more traditional operating environments of maritime, land and air.\nSpace- based capabilities enable strategic communications, command and control\n(C2), situational awareness (SA), and precision strike capabilities.\n1.8. Non-physical Battlespace:  \na. Electromagnetic Spectrum M anagement  (ESM):  This is  the planning,\ncoordination and management of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) thr ough\noper\national, engineering and administrative procedures. It enables military electronic\nsystems to perform their functions within intended environments without causing orsuffering harmful interference.\nb. Information. The information environment includes the information itself, t he\ni\nndividuals and organizations, in addition to the cognitive, virtual and physical space i n\nw\nhich this occurs. The importance of worldwide distributed information, the speed at\nwhich information is communicated, the role of media and the reliability of informati on\ns\nystems have created a situation in which no decision or action can be taken without\nconsidering its potential impact on the  information environment.\nc. Cyberspace. Cyberspace is the virtual, non- physical domain formed by all\ninformation technology systems interconnected on a global scale. Cyberspace attacks\nare becoming more intense, complex and reflective of an increased level  of\nsophistication. The risks and opportunities offered through offensive and defensiv e\nc\nyberspace activities make it an important element of the commander’s  battlespace\nmanagement plan.\nSERIAL 3-10-01 \n3–10–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 4 – May 2023 d. Time . While the environments comprise the places where military forces conduct\ntheir activities, time indicates when or for how long. Time is used as a tool t o\nor\nchestrate activities in all environments, through coordination and synchronization.\n1.9. Methods of Control:  These methods shown in the diagram are not mutually \nexclusive and several different controls are likely to be used simultaneously. \n1.10. Enabling Battlespace Management .  BM  is enabled by : \na. Combat Identification.  Combat ID is a BM measure; it contributes t o\nS\nituational Awareness (SA) and so enables to more effective BM.\nb. Situational Awareness (SA) .  SA – understanding the operating environment i n\nt\nhe context of the mission or task – provides the key to both effective Combat ID  and\nt\no efficient BM. Given the inevitable ‘fog of war’, perfect SA is unlikely and a JTFC\nshould judge for himself what represents sufficient SA in any given situation\nc.

TM encompasses the establishment of priority for use of the ground and \nallocation of land, the delegation of landspace control, tracking, activating and promulgating changes, monitoring of force levels within given landspace, EMCON, and \nestablishing robust coordinating instructions.  \nb. Priorities . Priority of use will be dictated by the nature of the operation but \ninclude:  \n(1) Int Collection Assets    & Comms assets  \n(2) Div Reserve     & GS engineering assets  \n(3) Formation HQ     & Utility Avn AH and SH \n(4) Ground Manoeuvre assets   & Second- line CSS  \n(5) OSG assets (incl ARAs / AMAs)   & Unoccupied AMAs  \nc. Bids for Landspace . The G3 Ops terrain / ops trace is the authority for unit \nlocations and control measures. Units requiring landspace in an area controlled by \nanother formation or component must bid through G3 Ops.  \n2.3. Fire Support Coordination Measures  (FSCM ). FSCM provide the means to \nseparate, synchronise or integrate land, air and maritime Fires to support the manoeuvre \ncommander’s intent and operations plan, and to  allow the maximum exploitation of available \nfire support assets while ensuring the safety  of own troops against blue- on-blue. By their \nnature, FSCM tend to be short term and  immediate. It is critical that FSCM are deactivated \nas soon as practical after a fire mission.  FSCM can either be permissive or restr ictive in \nnature. All boundaries are by default  Restricted Fire Lines (RFL):  \na. Permissive Measures . These facilitate the attack of targets. No further \ncoordination is required within permissive areas. These include:  \n(1) Fire Support Coordination Line (FSCL).  \n(2) Free Fire Area (FFA).  \n(3) Coordinated Fire Line (CFL).  \nb. Restrictive Measures. These provide safeguards to Friendly Forces or objects. \nTheir  establishment requires certain coordination to occur prior to the engagement of \nthose targets. Restrictive measures include:  \n(1) Airspace Coordination Areas (ACA).  \n(2) Restrictive Fire Lines (RFL).  \n(3) No Fire Areas (NFA).  \n(4) Restricted Fire Areas (RFA).  \nSERIAL 3-10-02 \n3–10–02 - 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 2.4.

General Points .  The airspace within a JOA is a joint environment and therefore it is \nmanaged on a joint basis.  Responsibility for managing the airspace - the Airspace Control \nAuthority (ACA) -  is usually given to the component best able to discharge that responsibility; \ninvariably the JFACC.  All users of the airspace must be aware of the problems and the \nmeasures taken to facilitate ops, identify users and minimize risks.  These measures are \ncollectively known as Airspace Control (ASC) and invariably represent a compromise \nbetween conflicting demands.  ASC is a service to airspace users.  Many land assets, such \nas BH, MLRS, arty, mors, UAVs and GBAD exploit the 3rd dimension.  All require airspace \nand need the minimum of restrictions to achieve tempo.  The ACA constructs an Air Control \nPlan (ACP) to support the Joint Campaign Plan and endeavours to take account of CCs’ requirements to meet the scheme of manoeuvre.  The ACP is fully compatible with the Joint  \nAir Defence Plan (ADP).  \n3.2. Control .  In the LCC HQ the AD cell will normally be responsible for Airspace Control \n(ASC) matters in conjunction with the LC representative in the Joint Airspace Coordination \nCentre (JACC).  AD coordinates unit ASC, requests Airspace Control Measures (ACM) and \ndisseminates Airspace Control Orders (ACO).  Subject to the JTFC priorities the LCC will \nusually have authority over air operations within the LCC AO short of the FSCL once a \nsuitable degree of control of the air has been achieved.  ASC is exercised through either \npositive or procedural control and as the operations situation may require a combination of \nboth methods they must be complementary.  \n3.3. Positive Control .  Relies on positive identification, tracking and direction of a \nplatform within designated airspace, conducted with electronic means by an agency with the appropriate authority and responsibility.  Consequently this type of control is asset intensive \nneeding equipment such as radar/surv sensors, ID procedures, 2- way comms/data links and \nother C4I elements to track, identify and direct.   \n3.4. Procedural Control .  Relies on a combination of previously agreed and promulgated \norders and procedures.  Procedural control may segment the airspace by volume and time \nand/or the use of weapon control status.  This form of control relies on ACMs and WCOs \nissued via the ACO  and Special Instructions (SPINS) to identify airspace access within \nagreed parameters.   \n3.5. Time Deconfliction.  \nFigure 3. 1 Illustrating time deconfliction ASM  \nSERIAL 3-10-03 \n3–10–03 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 Time deconfliction requires detailed coordination and may be required when aircrew fly near \nindirect fire trajectories or ordnance effects. The timing of surface fires must be coordinated \nwith aircraft routing.  \n3.6. Spatial Deconfliction . The separation of activities in space offers far more \nopportunities to integrate assets. Spatial deconfliction can be used to attack multiple \nadjacent targets simultaneously or, with detailed planning, the engagement of the same \ntarget. In order to achieve this, the aerial platforms’ flight paths or battle positions must be \ndeconflicted with weapon trajectories and effects. This method requires that the air vehicle is \noffset from weapon trajectories, and operating at safe distance from the point of impact . \n \nFigure 3. 2 Illustrating spatial deconfliction ASM  \n3.7. Summary .  Whichever method of ASC is in force it will have to be coordinated by the \nACA with all airspace users and promulgated in the ACO.  \n\nSERIAL 3-10-04 \n3–10–04 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 COMBAT ID  \n4.1. What is Combat ID (CID)?  CID is the process of attaining an accurate and timely \ncharacterisation of detected objects in the battlespace to support an engagement decision or \nof “combining Situational Awareness (SA), Target Identification (Tgt ID) and specific Tactics, \nTechniques and Procedures (TTPs) to increase operational effectiveness of weapon \nsystems and reduce the incidence of casualties caused by friendly fire.  \n4.2. Who is responsible for Combat ID?  The JTFHQ and all Component HQs are \nresponsible for ensuring C ombat ID is established to an appropriate degree to  minimise the \nrisk of fratricide in cross -component engagement.  \n4.3. How are errors made?  The following two areas impact on an individual’s ability to \nunderstand and judge the situation and establish CID  \na. Human Factors (HF): (eg stress, fatigue, fear, mental capacity, personality, \nexperience, ex pectation and briefing, culture, language and survival)  \nb. Operational  Characteristics : (eg sensitivity, complexity, environmental impact \nand change in ORBATs and groupings)  \n4.4. What methods can you use to establish Combat ID ?  A mixture of  these three \narea help establish strong combat ID:  \na. Situational Awareness (SA).   Situational awareness affects the expectation of \nan object’s presence in space and time being friendly or enemy. Familiarity with both \nthe plan and the current situation are essential and may be aided by command \nsystems and reports and returns .  \nb. Target Identification (Tgt ID) . Tgt ID involves recognition of the tgt or a \ncomponent part (eg an indicator beacon). Positive ID (PID) is established when the observer identifies an object. He may PID it as enemy, friendly or neutral. Negative ID \nis established when the observer is certain the object is not of a certain type but \ncannot confirm which type it is.  \nc. Tactics Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) .  TTPs affect the speed at which \nCID can be established and includes aspects of positive control, eg ensuring all FEs \nreport their current loc or when they are clear of an area prior to targeting, and \nprocedural control through BM measures eg bdrys/RFLs and OOB boxes.  \n4.5. Combat ID Com mand Responsibilities . \na. Pre-Action. Check:  \n(1) You understand ROE.  \n(2) CID measures and Fire Support Coordination Measures are in place.  \n(3) Familiarity with CID measures employed by own and allied forces.  \n(4) Likely loc and intent of EF units, veh and ac.  \n(5) Loc and intent of close FF units, veh and ac.  \n(6) Action to be taken if lost.  \n(7) All above info is current.  \nb.

Check:  \n(1) You are where you expected to be.  \n(2) You have informed CoC and adjacent units if you are not where you \nexpect to be.  \n(3) Any potential tgt is in a loc and acting in a way that makes sense iaw the \noperations picture.  \n(4) You only engage potential tgts that you PID as EF. Any potential tgt that \ncannot be PID as EF, FF (incl allies and partners) must be assumed neutral or \ncivilian until EF PID can be established.  \n(5) Rules Of Engagement & Collateral Damage Estimate permit engagement.  \n(6) Backstop is free of FF, neutrals and civilians  \nSERIAL 3-10-05 \n3–10–05 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 LIAISON : ESTABLISHING &  MANNING  COORDINATING POINTS  \n5.1. What is a Coordinating Point?   (also known as a “contact point”) \nThis is a designated point at which, in all types of combat, adjacent Land \nbased units/formations must make contact for purposes of control and \ncoordination. This may be to achieve tactical coordination, understanding \nand/or mutual support between units and formations that are working \ntogether.   \n5.2. What is a Liaison Team .  There are two types  \na. Establishing Team . The element from the unit/formation designated to establish \nand secure the coord point and receive the approaching unit.  \nb. Approaching Team . The element from the unit/formation designated to arrive at \nthe coordinating point after the establishing unit has secured it.  \n5.3. Manning a Coordination Point .  LOs should always be capable and competent.  \nCoord points may be manned in one of the following ways, normally specified by the higher \nHQ: \na. Full time by liaison teams from both adjacent units/formations. This will be \nnormal when adjacent units/formations are of different nationalities and may also be \nordered when the tactical situation requires close, continuous liaison.  \nb. Full time by the unit or formation designated to establish the coord point and \nvisited by a liaison team from the flanking unit or formation at specified times.  \nc. Periodically by liaison teams from flanking units/formations at a specified time or \ntimes.  \n5.4. Coordinating Instructions. The following must be specified by the HQ ordering the \ncoord point, confirmed by the units / formations involved and known by the liaison teams that \nwill man the point:  \na. Location of the coord point including a grid reference and description of the \nterrain feature.  \nb. Unit/formation responsible for securing (establishing unit) and the time by which \nthe point must be secured / established.  \nc. Times at which approaching teams are to RV.  \nd. Description of each unit’s / formation’s liaison team (number and type of \nvehicles/ personnel, call signs, radio frequencies, etc).  \ne. Route to be used to and from the point by both liaison teams.  \nf. Recognition signals to be employed.  \ng. Working language at the coord point.  \n5.5. Information. LOs need to know the following:  \na. Own HQ’s plan –  especially key timings, DPs and any CONPLANs, branches or \nsequels.  \nb. LOs should be aware of any OSW scheduled to be released during the period of \ntheir liaison task. LOs may deploy prior to their HQ’s O Gp and must make \narrangements to  receive both orders and any amdts or clarifications made during or \nafter orders or during ROC drills.  \nc. Clarity on the extent of their delegated authority to represent their comd’s point of \nview, if any.  \nd. Working knowledge of own doctrine to enable LOs to ‘read the battle’ by pre-\nempting likely modus operandi of own force as situation evolves. This is particularly \nimportant  when liaising across bdrys of cap badge, componency or multinationality.  \nFigure 5. 1 Coordinating  \npoint  on. map  \n",

1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 POLICY AND STRATEGY :  ENDS – WAYS – MEANS  \nCOMPETITION AND CONFLICT  \n1.1. National Security :  Kuwait’s national security originates both from national \nsovereignty, articulated and explained in Kuwait’s Constitution, and national interests. The \nfirst duty of the Amir of Kuwait and his Government is to maintain the freedom and integrity \nof the State and human security of the population, within the principles of Islam.  The Amir’s oath of office states:  \n “I swear by Almighty God to respect the Constitution and the laws of the State, to defend the \nliberties, interests, and properties of the people, and to safeguard the independence and \nterritorial integrity of the Country”\n1. \nKuwait’s national security includes the safety of the state and protecting it from external and \ninternal threats.  External threats may include invasion, attack or blockade.  Internal threats \nmay include terrorism, subversion, civil disorder, criminality, insurgency, sabotage and espionage.  Other threats include instability caused by financial crisis, climatic events, cyber \nor other forms of attack on critical national infrastructure and the possibility of pandemic disease affecting the population.  \n1.2. National Interest :  It is not the role of the Armed Forces to define national interest, \nthat is the responsibility of the Amir and Kuwait Government.  Kuwait’s national interest will seek to secure a range of broader interests – political, economic and social – that contribut e \nto the nation’s strength and prosperity and human security.  Such interests are interconnected and mutually supporting.  Without security and the ability of the Kuwaiti people to live their lives freely, the foundations of prosperity would be undermined. \n1.3. Government  Policy :  Kuwait’s chosen political outcomes, endstate and objectives \nare articulated in the Government’s national policy.  Policy articulates a choice leading to a \ncourse of action proposed or adopted by the government.  The Amir, Prime Minister, Cabinet \nand National Assembly are responsible for the Kuwait’s national policy. The government’s political intentions are articulated as a national strategic vision, aim or endstate, supported \nby strategic objectives.  Policy will be reviewed and renewed periodically as needed.  \n1.4. Kuwait Government ’s (National) Strategy:  National strategy defines, secures and \nadvances the nation’s long- term, enduring core interests and aims over time. Generally, \naims are based on security and prosperity.  National strategy coordinates the instruments of \nKuwait’s national power (Diplomatic - Information – Military – Economic) in pursuit of national \npolicy aims and objectives to secure Kuwait’s interests.  Formulating and executing national strategy is changeable and repeating circular activity.  Unexpected events and crises may \nalso radically change national strategy, requiring the military to operate outside of previous planning assumptions and Defence policy .  Kuwait will use a mixture of hard and soft power \nto influence other nations and secure their own aims. The balance of how they project their hard and soft power reflects the overall attitude of the nation. Descriptions of soft and hard \npower are below.  \n• Hard power . Hard power uses military and economic strength,\ncomplemented by diplomacy and information, to effectively influence actors or to\ndirectly change the course of events. Actors use hard power to attract, deter and\ncompel.\n• Soft power . Soft power is the ability to persuade or encourage others t\no\nadopt\n an alternative approach, primarily through cultural and ideological means or by\nencouraging emulation. Soft power is generally slower and more difficult to employ i n\n1 The Constitution of the State of Kuwait, 1962, Article 60, the Amir’s Oath of Office.  \nSERIAL 1 -01-01 \n1–01–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 a targeted way. Much of the process also lies outside a state’s control. Therefore, \napplying soft power demands: a campaign mindset; clear, consistent communication \nstrategies and measures of effectiveness; and a developed understanding of the \nintended audience and their societal attitudes and cultures. Diplomatic and \ninformation capabilities underpin soft power's effe ctiveness. \n1.5. Instruments  of National Power : DIME  – Diplomatic  – Information – Military  – \nEconomic.  \n• The Diploma tic Instrument.  I s about managing international relations to\nfurther national interests.  Successful diplomacy depends upon the power ofpersuasive negotiation, reinforced by capable and credible hard power (both military\nand economic).  Diplomacy is enhanced by a combination of reputation and integrity,\nthe skilful interplay of the other instruments of power and effective communication\n.\n• T\nhe Information Instrument . All States  operate in an informati on\nenv\nironment that has seen an exponential growth in information processing, data and\ndigital connectivity. The classification of information as a discrete instrument of power\nrecognizes audience centrality, public perception and information’s influenc e on\ndec\nision- makers. The information instrument often competes via narratives.\nNarratives are important because they give meaning to facts for audiences.\nNarratives are also used to align a nation’s actions across all the instruments of\npower.\n• The Military  Instrument . The priority of any national strategy is to defend t he\ns\ntate.  Military activities supporting national strategy and objectives can range from\ndeterrence and coercion through to applying force to counter a specific threat .\n• T\nhe Economic Instrument . The economic instrument is an influential har d\nand s\noft power tool, especially when used below the threshold of armed conflict. In  a\ngl\nobalized world, nations are attracted to economic alliances to gain an economic\nadvantage.\n1.6. Military Strategy .  Military Strategy constitutes the Military’s overall contribution to \nnational strategy and is a subset of it.  Military strategy is fundamentally about choices. It \nuses ends, ways and means to create a roadmap between the present and a desired future \nstate or condition, using military power, while providing flexible options on how best to arrive \nthere, expressed in coherent and clear terms . \n1.\n7. Ends, Ways & Means  (+ Risk) . In its simplest expression, strategy must balance the \napplication of ends (end state and objectives), ways (broad approaches) , means (resources)  \nand the level of risk deemed acceptable to achieve it. Having decided on the strategic ends \nand the role of the military force in achieving them, the ways through which the ends may be \nFigure 1-1 Illustrating the relationship between policy & strategy.  \nSERIAL 1 -01-01 \n1–01–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 achieved are discerned and elected, and then the means are allocated. Logical thinking \nmust be applied to ensure the means and ways are orchestrated to achieve the ends.  \n• Ends – t he military objectives that must be achieved in the operational are a\nt\no meet the endstate.\n• Means – what military capabilities resources are available to support the\noperation and should be applied; and how will these be integrated with the non-\nmilitary activities?\n• Ways – what sequence of actions is most likely to create the required effects;\nwhat approach will establish them; which instruments of power combine within these\napproaches; and how should actions be sequenced in time and space to achiev e\nt\nhem?\n• Risk – what is the probability and implications of an activity or event, and how\nmight it be managed or mitigated by scaling down ‘ends’ increasing ‘means’ or t he\nus\ne of ‘novel ways’ .\nUnderstanding Conflict – The Conflict Triangle  (AJP- 01) \n1.8. Understanding the causes of conflict underpins the ability to de- escalate and resolve \ndisputes. There are three fundamental causes of conflict, as illustrated in Figure 1.2 and explained below.  \n• Contradiction  is a\nn\ni\nssue over which conflicti ng\nbel\niefs and aims exist an d\nt\nhere might  be\ndi\nsagreement.\n• Attitude of t he\nact\nors – the perception of \nactors is shaped by their \nemotions, judgements and \ndesires towards the \ncontradiction, combined with \ntheir perceived advantage \nrelative to a competitor. Whether the perception is accurate or not is immaterial; neither is the merit of the contradiction. What matters is how actors perceive things, \nand what their beliefs are.  \n• Behaviour  that arises from attitudes and beliefs in a contradiction.\n1.9. The three elements of the conflict triangle interrelate and any one of them may be the \norigin for increased hostility between competitors.  \nContinuum of C ompetition (AJP- 01) \n1.10.  The continuum of competition is a model depicting how attitudes and behaviours \nshape international relations. The continuum depicts four types of relationships between states/groups of people: cooperation, rivalry, confrontation and armed conflict. The \nboundaries between cooperation, rivalry and confrontation, and the threshold between \nconfrontation and armed conflict, are complex and dynamic; the progression between each \nis neither linear nor easily defined. Interstate relations are typically sectoral: two  or more \nstates may cooperate in one sector and be in confrontation in another. The continuum is \ndescribed and illustrated in Figure 1. 3 below . \n• Cooperation . Cooperation occurs when states or non- state actors wor\nk\nt\nogether to achieve the same objectives. Often this occurs when actors’ attitudes  onConflict\nAttitudeContradictionBehaviour\nFigure 1.2 The Conflict Triangle\nSERIAL 1 -01-01 \n1–01–01 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 a contradiction align. The GCC  is an example of cooperation to protect and defend \nmember states' security. Cooperation provides the ideal basis for enduring stability.  \n \nFigure 1. 3 The Continuum of Competition  \n• Rivalry . Rivals exist in a state of peace but have conflicting aims or \ncontradictions. The actors compete with an attitude or behaviour in accordance with \nthe rules -based international order (RBIO). The RBIO is a shared commitment by all \ncountries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules that evolve over time through multinationally agreed processes. Rivalry is not necessar ily negative, it \nis the normal state in international relations, and when it exists within the RBIO \nframework it can be beneficial to all parties and the international system.  \n• \nConfrontation. Confrontation occurs when differences have not been \nreconciled and adversaries oppose each other with hostile intent or behaviour \nsuch that a state of crisis develops. Adversaries use hostile behaviour or \nattitudes, including posturing, threats and perhaps  violence, as a competitive tool \nto resolve the contradictions in their favour. There is no defined threshold that separates confrontation from armed conflict because many actors intentionally try \nto obscure or confuse exactly where this thr eshold lies. \n \n• Armed conflict . Armed conflict occurs when escalation cannot be prevented \nor contained, leading to one party resorting to military force to compel their enemy to \nresolve the contradiction in their favour. Armed conflict is a special kind of \ncompetition because it is not  enduring; its role is to set the conditions for other forms \nof competition. Since armed conflict includes acts of nationally directed military \nviolence, it invariably has an exponential effect on human emotions, uncertainty and \nfriction. Mor eover, armed conflict is an extreme trial of physical and moral strengths, \nand tests both institutional and individual resources of endurance and resilience.  \nWar & Warfare  \n1.11.  War.  War is a state of armed conflict between different countries, or different groups \nwithin a country.  ( States seldom officially declare war in the modern era) . \n1.12.  Warfare .  Warfare is the conduct of war.  It is “the how” of waging war.  Warfare \ncontinues to change, evolve and be transformed by society, diplomacy, politics, and \ntechnology.  \n\nSERIAL 1 -01-02 \n1–01-02 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – Mar 2025 \nKUWAIT NATIONAL SECURITY & DEFENCE POLICY  \nAND CRISIS RESPONSE & STRATEGIC PLANNING \n2.1.

Levels of Operations : The levels of operations provide a framework within which to \nrationalise and categorise military activity.  It consists of 3 overlapping levels as shown in \nFigure 3.1 .  This offers a general framework with which to plan and execute operations, and \na useful tool to organize and consider political/military activity.  This framework does not imply where decisions must be \nmade.  Events at one level ca nnot \nbe isolat ed from ano ther and the \nlevels generally overlap.  \n3.2. Strategic Level.  The Amir \nand Kuwait G overnment at t he \npolitical- strategic l evel, d etermines \nKuwait’s strategic end s tate and \nobjectives .  The st rategic  level \ndetermines t he military \ncontributions t o operations and \nstarts t he relationshi p with other \nstates and actors t o deliver \ncomplementary or su pporting \nactions t o achieve  collective  \nsecurity obj ectives .  Scarce or \npolitically se nsitive capabilities ar e \noften co mmanded at t his level. \n3.\n3. Operational Level. The \noperational level is defined by its role, which is to link and resource tactical -level activities to \nstrategic objectives. It is the essential gearing between the strategic and the tactical levels, \nwhere campaigns and major joint operations are planned, and actions are integrated and \nsequenced to achieve strategic objectives.   Capabilities that are required by multiple tactical \ncommands are often controlled at the operational level to enable them to be allocated when \nrequired.  \n3.4. Tactical Level .  The tactical level of operations is the level at which activities, battles \nand engagements are planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to \ntactical formations and units. The tactical level uses the echelons of command to further \nintegrate, prioriti se and coordinate their activity. This activity creates a range of effects that \ntogether contribute to successful operations . \n3.5. Relationship between the levels of operations.  The relationship between what is \ntactical  level, operational l evel and strategic level  is both fluid and contextual.  Tactical level \ngains and losses may have far greater strategic  level effects than that which is immediately \nobvious.  There is however a difference of focus between command at different levels.  In \npractice, even this apparently clear difference does not stop intervention by strategic level \npolitical and military leaders seeking to influence tactical level activity and giving lower -level \ncommanders very specific direction on what to do, as well as how to do it.  This might be when there is a clear political necessity to intervene at a certain time, in a certain place or in a certain way . \n3.6. Operational Art. Operational art is the mechanism the military uses to implement \nstrategies. Operational art combines the science of planning and the guidance from the tenets of doctrine with the skill, knowledge, experience, creativity and judgement of \nFigure 3.1 The \nLevels of \nOperations  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 commanders and staff to design and conduct strategies, campaigns and tactical operations \nto achieve policy goals and higher strategic objectives. \n3.7. Operational Domains (x5) :  (AJP- 01 & UK JDP  0-01 use slightly different wording)  \nA specified sphere of capabilities and activities that can be applied within an engagement \nspace.   (JDP 0 -01.1, UK Terminology Supplement to NATO  Term , 2023 Edition)   \nOperational domains represent five specific spheres of military activity within the \nengagement space and provide a framework for organizing the military instrument. The term \n‘operational’ does not reflect the operational level of operations, it reflects operations and \nactivity. These operational domains provide a structural framework to group and analyse \ncapabilities that are unprejudiced by considerations of nations, political, military services or civilian ownership. Though capabilities are distinctive, some capabilities may act as a \nplatform for other domain capabilities. The characteristics of the operational domains are as follows : \n• Maritime domain. The maritime domain comprises capabilities and activities\nprimarily related to operating below, on and above the surface of the oceans, seas, bays,\nestuaries, islands, coastal areas and at the high- water mark, overlapping with the l\nand\ndom\nain in the landward segment of the littorals .\n• Land domain. The land domain comprises capabilities and activities primarily\nrelated to operating on the Earth’s land mass, ending at the high -water mark and\nov\nerlapping with the maritime domain in the landward segment of the littorals.\n• Air domain . The air domain comprises capabilities and activities primarily related t o\noper\nating in the airspace that begins at the Earth’s surface (overlapping with the maritim e\nand l\nand domains) and extending to the altitude where atmospheric effects on airbor ne\nob\njects become negligible.\n• Space domain . The space domain comprises activities and capabilities primarily\nrelated to operating in space, where atmospheric effects on airborne objects becom e\nnegl\nigible but its capabilities are enabled by assets on Earth. Therefore, the spac e\ndom\nain includes the satellites in orbit and beyond, supporting ground infrastructure  and\nt\nhe information layer connecting ground and space.\n• Cyber & Electromagnetic domain . The cyber and electromagnetic domai n\nc\nomprises capabilities and activities primarily related to operating within t he\ni\nnterdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data. This\nincludes the Internet, telecommunications network s, computer systems, em bedded\npr\nocessors, controllers and the electromagnetic waves with frequencies that constitut e\nt\nhe electromagnetic spectrum.\n• Information.  Although information is not a domain, information activities ar e\noper\national domain actions whose primary focus is to create a cognitive effect.  The\ni\nntegration of information operations staff in planning processes ensure that the full range\nof domain and information activities required to achieve a successful outcome ar e\nhar\nnessed. Successful integration of actions, within and across domains, enables  the\nc\nommander to gain and maintain the initiative by enhancing pre- emption,  surprise,\nsimulta neity, tempo and exploitation. This generates greater freedom  of manoeuvre in the\nengagement space to create physical, virtual and  cognitive effects within their operations\narea.\n3.8. Effects  and their Physical, Virtual and C ognitive Dimensions.  An effect is a \nchange to the engagement  / battle  space as a consequence of action. Derived from \nobjectives, effects bridge the gap between the different planning concepts; objectives and \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 actions , by describing what changes in the engagement  / battlespace space are required. \nThere are three types of effects  dimensions : physical, virtual and cognitive  \n3.9. Effect Dimensions . Effect dimensions highlight the interdependencies of the \nengagement  / battle space, thereby gaining a better understanding of the consequences of \nactions. The elements that constitute dimensions are as follows. \n• The physical dimension.  This  relates to consequences on the audiences, t he\ns\nub-surface, surface, airspace and space areas where all physical activities take place,\nand where audiences live, including all physical objects and infrastructure that support\nthem.\n• The cognitive dimension.  This relates to the consequences on the audiences’\nperceptions, beliefs, interests, aims, decisions and behaviours. It encompasses all forms\nof interaction between them (such as economic and political).\n• The virtual dimension.  This  relates to the consequences of activity on t he\ns\ntorage, content and transmission of analogue and digital data and information, and all\nsupporting communication and information systems and processes.\n3.10.  Effect Dimensions in Op Art .  Considering effect dimensions supports a \ncommander to use the manoeuvrist approach to achieve objectives by cognitively, physically \nand virtually  out-manoeuvring hostile audiences. This is done by identifying indirect and \noriginal ways of affecting points of influence and/or converging mass effects to overwhelm \npoints of influence defences, whilst dislocating the actor's strengths.  \n3.11.  Effects Dimensions in a Comprehensive Approach.  Effect dimensions provide a \nframework for the political, military and civilian partners to coordinate and synchronize their forces’ activities in time and space to create mutually supporting desired effects, whilst respecting the autonomy of each actor.  \n3.12.  Campaigns & O perations:  \n• A campaign is defined as: “A set of military operations planned and conducted t\no\nac\nhieve a strategic objective.” (AAP- 06 (2014)).\n• An operation is defined as: “a sequence of coordinated actions with a defi ned\npur\npose” (AAP -06)\n3.13.  Environments & systems. There are multiple types of environments, both physical \nand non- physical, and commanders use many terms to describe them. Examples include \n(but are not restricted to): information, maritime, urban, political and human. \n• Environment s.  An environment describes the system surrounding an activity.\n• Systems.  A system is a functionally, physically or behaviourally related group of\nregularly interacting or interdependent elements. A group of systems is a network.\n• The Operating Environment is defined as :\n“a composite of the conditions, circumstances and influences that affect the employment\nof capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander.” ( AJP-5 (2019 )).\nWe can understand the operating environment as a global set of complex, dynamic and interrelated networks, comprising political, military, economic, social, infrastructure and \ninformation systems, each exerting pressure and influence on the others. Underst anding \nthe nature and interaction of these systems as part of mission analysis helps the \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 commander define their engagement space and affects how they will integrate actions \nwith in it.  \n• The Information Environment is defined as : “An environment comprised of the\ninformation itself, the individuals, organizations and systems that receive, process  and\nconvey the information, and the cognitive, virtual and physical space in which this\noccurs. ” (AAP- 06 (2020))\n• Engagement space/battlespace . The engagement space and battlespace are\nsynonyms. The engagement space is part of the operating environment  where actions\nand activities are planned and conducted. The commander’s engagement space is oftenbroader than their operations area due to increasing interconnectivity of the effect\ndimensions. Furthermore, the varying degrees of relevance that geography  has i\nn\nc\nyberspace and space, the electromagnetic spectrum and the information environment\nmeans that a geographically bounded engagement space is  not always suitable.\n3.14. NATO Campaign Themes (AJP -01).  To hel p the planning and conduct of \ncampaigns and link them to the continuum of competition1 it is desirable to define the \ncampaigns theme.   \n• The c\nampaign themes use the concept of limitations (such as objective, means,\narea, time, rules of engagement and other political constraints) and the concept ofintensity (the expected degree and frequency of violence of the subordinate operations)\nto pro vide the framework for campaigns\n.\n• The t\nheme gives an understanding of the general conditions of the operati ng\nenv\nironment and the main type of military operations and activities it will be necessary to\nconduct.  It helps commanders and planners balance the military operations and activitiesthat comprise any campaign , including organizing their forces and allocating resources.\n• Types of operations are not fixed to a campaign theme and the composition of\noperations within each theme is fluid and depends on the operating environment\n and\npol\nitical appetite.  For example, combat operations can be conducted in warfighting,\nsecurity and peace support campaigns. However, combat operations would be scarce i n\npeac\ne support but may be predominant in warfighting campaigns.  The four types of\nCampaign themes are:\n1 See SOHB Serial  1-01-01. \nFigure 3. 2 The common relationship between the campaign themes and the contin uum of competition  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 • P\neacetime Military Engagement .  The peacetime military engagement them e\nenc\nompasses those military activities that are intended to shape the peacetim e\nenv\nironment to encourage local or regional stability  in the medium to long- term.\nP\nersistent engagement creates relationships and develops mutual understanding,\ninfluence and interoperability through: building partners' capacity; defence diplomacy;\noutreach; multinational training exercises; and other cooperative security activities.Humanitarian relief activities are the results of complex emergencies involving natural or\nhuman- made disasters or other endemic conditions, such as disease, hunger or p rivation .\nPeacetime Military Engagement is sometimes called Defence Engagement.\n• Peace Support .  This theme takes place in the rivalry zone of the continuum of\ncompetition.  The theme seeks to preserve peace or intervene early within a potential\nconflict to maintain stability, prosperity and the rule of law. Activities guided by this theme\ncontribute to the comprehensive approach on a range of civilian tasks to redress t\nhe\nc\nontradictions of a conflict, including: maintaining public order and security; security\nsector reform; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; transitional justice;\ninfrastructure reconstruction; and national reconciliation. The theme implies both soft and\nhard power actions. Soft power and hard power’s attraction comes throughdevelopmental actions aimed at enhancing a government's willingness and ability to c ar\ne\nf\nor its people. Hard power’s coercive actions apply a cost or a denial -of-benefits to those\nwho try and stretch the boundary of the peace settlement or the RBIO. This them e\npr\nedominantly consists of peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities.\n• Security .  The security campaign theme applies within the confrontation zone of the\ncontinuum of competition, with the five principles of deterrence being implicit in t he\nt\nheme’s nature.   The security theme implies that the state  detects, deters and, if required,\nresponds to strategic competition’s operating techniques, especially threshold shifting.This may be contesting sub- threshold activity or conducting peace enforcement pre - or\npost-warfighting operations . These are  operating environment s where Armed Forces are\nused to re -establish stability and prosperity, underpinned by the rule of law.  Security is\nnot absolute, commanders are likely to support the activities of other actors in protecting,\nstrengthening and restoring civil society, governance, rule of law and the economy.\nExamples include counter -insurgency (COIN) operations, contribute to stabilizati\non and\nr\neconstruction operations, or a mixture of both.\n• Warfighting.  Warfighting occurs above the threshold of armed conflict  of the\nc\nontinuum of competition .  Warfighting takes place when the conflict has reached a point\nthat the only way to change behaviour, attitude or resolve a contradiction is primarilythrough armed force.  Activity will be usually a series of  high-intensity engagements\nthrough one or more domains with effects created in all dimensions against a significantform of armed aggression perpetrated between one or more states, or a well -organiz\ned\nand r\nesourced non -state actor.  It is likely the enemy will combine unconventional  and\ns\nub-threshold methods with their combat operations as part of an overall strategy.  As a\nresult, the wider effects of armed conflict may be less bounded by traditional distinctions,\nsuch as the home base and theatre of operations. This theme will predominantly consist\nof combat and major crisis response operations.\n3.15.  Spectrum of Conflict :  Figure 3. 3 below depicts the spectrum of conflict in relation \nto the level of anticipated violence and scale of operation.  The NATO campaign themes are \nmaped on the spectrum.  On the far left, stable peace is characterized by the absence of \nconflict, on the far right, there is high -intensity conflict.  Within the spectrum, levels of \nviolence are not clearly distinguished but both blend into one another, transition quickly and can vary in space and time.  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 3.\n16. Types of Operations (AJP -03).  Operations are also categorized with reference to \nessential characteristics that differentiate them from one another.  Within the spectrum of \nconflict, all types of operations may be developed according to Kuwait’s needs.  The same \ntype of operation may take place at different points of the spectrum of conflict and be related \nto different campaign themes depending on the level of violence faced in the operating \nenvironment.  The two major types of operation (NATO compliant) are:  \n1. Combat .  Combat operations may be required to directly defend Kuwait against  an\naggr\nessor.  Combat operations tend to be characterized by a series of battles and major\nengagements, and therefore involve intense activity and high logistic consumption.\n2. Crisis  response .  Crisis response operations (CROs) include multifunctional\noperations, which contribute to conflict prevention and resolution, humanitarian purposes\nor crisis management in pursuit of declared National objectives.  CROs may be as\ndemanding and intense as  combat operations.   Crisis Response is sometimes referred to\nas Stability.  Crisis response is further divided into:\n• Military contribution to  Counter -irregular Activities . Counter -irregular\nactivities fall into three categories :\nCounter -insurgency .  COIN is defined as: “comprehensive civili an and\nm\nilitary efforts made to defeat an insurgency and to address any core\ngrievances ”.  The military instrument is only one element of the\ncomprehensive approach necessary for successful COIN, although thesecurity situation may require the joint force to execute tasks that other\norganizations are better suited to conduct.\nCounter -terrorism.  Counter -terrorism is all preventive, defensive\n and\nof\nfensive measures taken to reduce the vulnerability of forces, individuals  and\npr\noperty against terrorist threats and/or acts, to respond to terrorist acts.  I n\nK\nuwait this can include measures to recover after such acts.\nCounter -criminality . Counter -criminality is the action focused on preventi ng\nor\nganized criminal groups from escalating their activities to the point where\nthey become a threat to Kuwait.\n• Military contribution to Peace Support .  Operations contributing to peac e\ns\nupport efforts impartially make use of diplomatic, civil and military means, normally\nin pursuit of UN Charter purposes and principles, to restore or maintain peace.\nSuch operations include conflict prevention, peace enforcement, peacekeeping,\nFigure 3. 3 The \nSpectrum of Conflict  \nschematic of \nCampaign Themes  \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 peacemaking and peacebuilding.   Details are in AJP- 3.24 The Military Contribution \nto Peace Support.  \n• Military contribution to Humanitarian Assistance.  Humanitari an\nas\nsistance consists of activities and tasks which relieve or reduce human suffering.\nHumanitarian assistance may occur in response to both natural and man -made\ndi\nsasters.\n• Military contribution to Stabili sation and Reconstruction.  Stabilisati on\nand r\neconstruction are normally a civilian -led process that commonly takes plac e\ndur\ning, or after, crisis in states that have lost the capacity to govern themselves\neffectively.\n• Military contribution to Non- combatant evacuation . Non -combatant\nevacuation operations (NEO) are national diplomatic initiatives, with military forces\nparticipating in a supporting role. NEOs are operations conducted to relocate (to a\nplace of safety) non- combatants threatened in a foreign country.\n• Extraction.  Extraction operations may be described as missions where a\nforce conducts or assists in the withdrawal of military missions and units from a\ncrisis region.\n• Military Contribution to Sanctions and Embargoes.  In broad terms,\nenforcing sanctions and embargoes is designed to force a nation to obey\ninternational law or to conform to a resolution or mandate.  Examples are exclusi on\nz\nones, no fly zones\n• Military Contribution to Freedom of Navigation and Overflight .  Thes e\noper\nations are conducted to demonstrate international rights to navigate sea or air\nroutes.  Freedom of navigation is a sovereign right accorded by international law.\n3.17.  · Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA) . MACA is assistance is by the Armed \nForces to other government departments , which contributes to homeland resilience, for \nurgent work of national importance, responding to emergencies or in maintaining supplies and essential services. In addition, the Armed Forces may provide support to civil law \nenforcement agencies, such as the police or Border Force, in the maintenance of law, order \nand public safety using specialist capabilities or equipment beyond that of civil powers. \n3.18.  Tactical Military  Activity :  Experience demonstrates that a wide range of military \nactivities are required simultaneously during any type of  operation, rather than a single focus \nor sequential progression.  The 4 types of types of tactical military activity are:  \n•Offensive.\n•Defensive.\n•Stability .\n•Enabling.\nAll operations are a balance of tactical activities, the amount of each tactical military activity \nvarying over time and between types of operation.  Conducting successful operations depends on understanding the type, quantity and simultaneity of these activities, how it \nevolves and changes through the campaign/operation; how it affects the planning and execution of operations and activities.  This is balance of tactical activities is illustrated in Fig \n3.4 below . \nSERIAL 0 1-01-03 \n1–01-03 – 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – Mar 2025 3.\n19. Boundaries & Areas:  T he area in which operations will be conducted is organi sed \nand labelled in such a way that all elements of a JTF have a common understanding of its \nprincipal boundaries.  B oundaries are mission- dependent.  Boundaries will be used to \nenhance flexibility delineated by areas, limited by defining parameters such as time.   It is \nrecognized that the operating environment may expand, become more dispersed and non-linear.   \n•Theatre of Operations  (TOO) . A designated area, which may include one or mor\ne\nJ\nOA. A theatre of operations may include land, air, space and sea outside a JOA.\n•Joint Operations Area  (JOA).  Joint operations area. A JOA is a temporary area\ndefined by the strategic military commander, in which a designated commander JTFplans and executes  a specific mission at the operational level.

Introduction .  The Military Forces of any nation rarely work alone in isolation.  They \nmust always consider the contribution each military element; agency, government \ndepartment and Multi -National (MN) partner might play during an operation and work out \nhow they will integrate each into the relevant area of their HQ.  The manner in which this is \ndone is not prescriptive.   \n4.2. Comprehensive Approach.   The Comprehensive Approach is ‘ Combining all \navailable political, military and civilian capabilities, in a concerted effort, to attain the desired \nend state.’ (NATO definition)  This whole of government approach  (in NATO the ‘ whole of \nalliance  approach’ ) can consist of  Combined, Joint, Interagency, Inter -Governmental & Multi -\nNational (CJIIM) actors working alongside each other.  A comprehensive approach aims to \nbuild closer links and liaisons with relevant organizations and actors, on a regular basis, \nwhile respecting the decision- making autonomy of each organization.  NATO sees its \ncontribution to the  comprehensive approach  as having:  \n• Shared Outcomes . To achieve shared outcomes all participants involved i n\nc\nrisis resolution should think about the outcomes required to deliver a favourabl e\ns\nituation.\n• D\nialogue and C ooperation.  Dialogue and cooperation requires all parties t o\nac\ntively try and work together, both ahead of and during a crisis.\n• D\nistinctive Cultures of Different Agencies .  The joint force needs t o\nac\nknowledge the distinctive cultures of different agencies it will be partnered with.\nPartners will exist with their own mandates, aims and objectives.\n• M\nutual Dependence .  Mutual dependence is the quality where organisations\nrely on other organisations capabilities to achieve sharded outcomes.\n• S\nhared Situational Awareness. Shared Situational Awareness will allow\npartners to better understand who is doing what, where.\n• I\nmprove the ability to work effectively internally through civil -military\ninteraction .  Key here is to optimise the effectiveness of partners, so they can deliver\ntheir functions as best they can.\n4.\n3. Combined.  Operations conducted with forces from two  or more allies are referred to \nas Combined Operations.   There will be a defined command relationship between the forces . \n\nSERIAL 1 -01-04 \n1–01–04 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 4.4. Joint .  At the strategic level, operations in which forces from at least two  Services \nparticipate are known as Joint Operations.  This may lead to the establishment of a J TFHQ  \nwith defined command authority . \n4.\n5. Inter -Agency.  This refers to the range of agencies, both national and international, \nthat may be involved in a Theatre of Operations.  These include Other Government \nDepartments (OGDs), national intelligence agencies, international police organisations, Host Nation (HN) or indigenous partners, NGOs, humanitarian groups, private military and \nsecurity companies, and other contractors.  \n4.\n6. International Organisation (IO) .  An intergovernmental, regional or global \norganization governed by international law and established by a group of states, with \ninternational juridical personality given by international agreement, however characterized, \ncreating enforceable rights and obligations for the purpose of fulfilling a given function and pursuing common aims.  Note: Exceptionally, the International Committee of the Red Cross, \nalthough a non -governmental organization formed under the Swiss Civil Code, is mandated \nby the international community of states and is founded on international law, specifically the Geneva Conventions, has an international legal personality or status on its own, and enjoys some immunities and privileges for the fulfilment of its humanitarian mandate.  \n4.\n7. Multinational .  Adjective used to describe activities, operations and organizations, in \nwhich elements of more than one nation participate.  \n4.8. Multi -Nationality .  A Multi -national force is composed of military elements as follows:  \n•Coalition.  A Coalition is an ad hoc arrangement\nbetween two or more nations operating together for a\ncommon, defined and usually limited purpose.\n•A\nlliance .  An Alliance is a broader, longer term agreement for collectiv e\nac\ntion with agreed mutual responsibilities.

Dependent on\nmembership, a Coalition may have a self -evident or designated lead nation (such as the\nUS). An Alliance, such as NATO, whilst comprising equal partners, may adopt a lead or\nframework nation.  The framework nation may undertake additional responsibilities (byexample, the provision of the operational commander, the majority of the operational HQstaff, and operational CIS infrastructure). Detailed arrangements will vary from operati\non\nto ope\nration.\n4.9. Partnerships.  Partnerships usually refer to those between foreign coalition and \nindigenous security forces and may involve Security Sector Reform (SSR) and Military \nCapacity Building (MCB).  \nSERIAL 1-01-05 \n1–01–05 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 THE COOPERATION COUNCIL for the ARAB STATES of the GULF  \n & PENINSULAR SHIELD FORCE   \n5.\n2.

The Cooperation Council for the \nArab States of the Gulf (ﻣﺠﻠﺲ اﻟﺘﻌﺎون ﻟﺪول  اﻟﺨﻠﯿﺞ ,) originally \n(and still colloquially) known as the Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil ( GCC, ﻣﺠﻠﺲ اﻟﺘﻌﺎون اﻟﺨﻠﯿﺠﻲ ,) is a regional \nintergovernmental political economic and military \nunion consisting of Arab St ates of the Arabian Gulf. Its \nmember states are Kuwait, S audi Arabia, B ahrain, t he \nUnited Arab Emirates, Q atar, and Oman.  The Charter Figure 5.1 The Flag of the GCC  \nof the Gulf Cooperation Council was signed on 25 May 1981, formally establishing the \ninstitution.

The Ministerial Council formulat es\npol\nicies and making recommendations for promotion of cooperation among the\nMember States and achieving coordination among the Member- States for\nimplementation of the on -going projects.  It submits its decisions in the form of\nrecommendations to the Supreme  Council for its approval.\n•The Secretariat General .  The functions of the Secretariat General are broadly t he\npr\neparation of special studies relating to cooperation, coordination, planni ng and\npr\nogramming for common action, preparation of periodical reports regarding the work\ndone by the GCC, following up the implementation of its own decisions,  preparati on\nof\n reports and studies on the demand of either the Supreme Council or the Ministerial\nCouncil,   making arrangements for holding of the meetings of various organs,\nfinalization of their agenda and drafting resolutions.\n5.4. GCC Security cooperation.  The Gulf Security Agreement, signed at Manama in \nDecember 2000 was primarily about the GCC making the transition from co- operating on \nmatters of defence to a position of collective self -defence.  Accordingly, member states \nagreed that external aggression against any member would be regarded as aggression against them all; that any threat facing one state would be regarded as a threat to all, and \nwould necessitate various measures, including the use of military force, being taken to aid \nthe victim of aggression.  The agreement also provided for the development of  a GCC \nDefence Council  and the Peninsula Shield Force , and for the enhancing of military \ncooperation by arranging joint military exercises, agreeing on defence policies, and augmenting the countries’ collective defence capacity by strengthening the local arms industry.   In addition, it was agreed that all collaborative activities would fall under the \ndirection and supervision of the GCC’s Supreme Council  through its Defence Council’s \nHigh Military Committee, whose meetings are coordinated by the Assistant  Secretary  \nGeneral for Military Affairs.  \n5.5. The Peninsular Shield Force.  At its third summit \nheld in November 1982, the GCC’s Supreme Council decided \nto constitute a combined force composed of 5,000 soldiers \ndrawn from the six member states  to foster cooperation and \npartnership.  At its 26th summit held in mid- December 2005, \nthe Supreme Council decided to expand the strength of the force and diversify its armaments.  It became a mechanised \nforce composed of foot soldiers, armoured carriers, artillery and combat support elements. Since its inception,  the force \nhas held periodic training sessions and joint military exercises with the armed forces of each of the member states. The first such exercise took place in the \nUnited Arab Emirates in 1983. From 1986 onwards, training has been centralised at King \nKhalid Military City in Hufer al- Batin in northeast Saudi Arabia.   Combined Joint exercises \nare held every 2 years in one of the Member States.  \nFigure 5. 3 The badge of the\nPeninsular Shield Force  \nSERIAL 1-01-06 \n1–01–06 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION (NATO)  \n6.1. Introduction .  The North Atlantic Treaty organisation (NATO) is a political  and \nmilitary  alliance  of member countries .  The foundations of NATO were officially laid down on \n4 April 1949 with the signing by the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty, more \npopularly known as the Washington Treaty .  Article 5 of NATO’s founding charter, the \nWashington Treaty, sets out the Alliance’s collective defence commitment.   It states that an \nattack on one shall be considered an attack on all.  Article 5 has been invoked only once in \nNATO’s history, on 12 September 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks on the United \nStates.    \n6.2. Members of N ATO :  At pr esent, NATO \nhas 32 members.  In 194 9, the 12 f ounding \nmembers o f the Alliance  were : Belgium, C anada, \nDenmark, F rance, I celand, Italy,  Luxe mbourg, \nthe Netherlands,  Norway, P ortugal, t he U nited \nKingdom and the United States.  The other \nmember countries are: Greece and Türkiye   \n(1952), Germany ( 1955), S pain (1982), t he \nCzech  Republic, H ungary and Pol and (1999), \nBulgaria, E stonia, La tvia, Li thuania, R omania, \nSlovakia, S lovenia (2004), and Albania and \nCroatia (2009) Montenegro (2017) North \nMacedonia (2020). Finland (2023). Sweden \n(2024) . \n6.3. NATO’s Purpose:  NATO’s \nessential pur pose  is to safeguard t he \nfreedom and se curity of i ts members \nthrough political and military m eans. \n•P\nOLITICAL - NATO  promotes\ndemocratic values and encourages\nconsultation and cooperati on on\ndef\nence and security issues to buil d\nt\nrust and, in the long run, prevent\nconflict.\n•MILITARY - NATO  is committed t o\nt\nhe peaceful resolution of disputes.\nIf diplomatic efforts fail, it has t he\nm\nilitary capacity needed t o\nunder\ntake crisis -management\noperations.

There is a difference of focus between command at different levels  as shown in \nfigure 7.1.  The operational level is  defined as:  “the level of operations at which campaigns \nand major operations are planned, conducted and sustained to accomplish strategic \nobjectives within theatres or areas of operations”.    \n7.\n2. The operational level \nprovides the vital bridge between \nstrategic objectives and the tactical employment of forces.  At the \noperational level and within a designated joint operations area (JOA), armed forces are deployed and employed in accordance with \na strategy to achieve military -strategic objectives. \n7.3. Normally this requires sustained operations with often \nsimultaneous and sequential actions by committed forces.  It \nis at the operational level that tactical success in \nengagements and operations are combined to create desired effects to achieve strategic objectives and attain the NATO end state.  Of prime importance is for the operational level \nCommander to understand clearly how his activities link  with \nother strategic lines of operation within a comprehensive \napproach and with coalition partners and a llies. \n7.4. Stages of a Joint operation .  A joint operation \nnormally consists of a number of stages some of which occur at the military strategic level (for example force generation). Typical stages at the operational level, which may overlap depending on the situation and mission, are shown in the \nfigure 7.2 to the right.   \n7.5. Componency:   In a joint operation, the highest \ntactical levels are the components operating directly under \nthe commander joint task force.   Components are groupings \nof force elements normally organized by service or function, \nbut the force will be organized to reflect each specific operational requirement.  Few modern operations are carried \nout, let alone won, by one component working alone.   The \nessential point is that  a successful joint campaign requires a \nFigure 7.1 The Levels of Operations  \nFigure 7.2 Stages of a Joint Operation  \nSERIAL 1-01–07 \n1–01–07 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 holistic approach to maximise the overall operational effect of the joint force, making best \nuse of the complete range of military capabilities.  Joint Operations are  not about separat ing \ncomponent operations in to stovepipes organised under a single point of command .  Joint \nOperations must synchronise and integrate the component capabilities at the JTFHQ level , \nas shown in figure 7.3 below .   \n7.\n6. Integration  of Components into the Joint Task Force.  Integration of components \nshould start prior to the operation. It demands thorough joint (and possibly multinational/multi -agency) preparation and training to develop mutual trust and \nunderstanding, and instil unity of effort. Successful operations are invariably characterised \nby constant liaison and effective communications.  \n7.7. Force Preparation .   Maintaining large deployable forces at high readiness  is \ninefficient. Most nations  operate  the principle of graduated readiness, by which Armed  \nForces are held at varying levels of preparedness to ensure an effective response by an \nappropriate force when required. The warning time is the period between first  indication of a \npotential crisis and the point at which committed forces are to be ready  for operations in \ntheatre.  Its main elements are illustrated below in Figure 7.4: \nFigure 7.4 Illustrating how to calculate a unit warning time for planning purposes.  A unit will move through a \nseries of preparation and training to ensure it is ready to be employed on operations.

Also See Serial 1-02-03 \nLand Doctrine Fundamentals . \n8.1. Land Power .  Land power is defined as: “the ability of land forces to exert decisive \ncontrol and influence on actors and the course of events ”.  Land \noperations cover all the activities planned and conducted by \nthe land component co mmander ( LCC).  The nature of land \noperations reflects the diversities and complexities of the \nLand Domain.  The land is unique in that it is where people \nlive.  L and oper ations ha ve to deal w ith the co mplexity o f a \ndomain characterize d by t he pr esence  of peopl e and their \ninfrastructure.  The totality of this co mplexity is m ore obvious \non the Land and requires an approach  that e mphasizes \ndecentralized command, f reedom of ac tion, tempo and \ninitiative, t o contend with t he m ultitude of problems,  activities \nand rapidly ch anging situations.   \n8.2.

The Organisation of Land Forces. Land forces are generally structured \nhierarchically into formations, units and subunits and categorised by function, type and \nspecialist capabilities.  They are organised operationally by combining arms to form a \ncohesive and versatile whole.   \n8.5. Land Unit Hierarchy.  A typical hierarchy flows down from Army Group to Army , \nCorps , Division , Brigade, Unit and Sub-Unit. Formations and units are designed to be \nmodular and scalable, so that elements can be easily added or taken away, and they can be \nexpanded or contracted. The greatest capacity for this lies in corps and divisions.  \n8.6. Functional groupings : Land forces are categorised functionally as either combat, \ncombat support or combat service support force elements  \n•Combat : force elements are those that engage the enemy directly. They manoeuvre\nand fight, typically employing direct fire weapons, to gain ground, find and defeat the\nenemy, or acquire information. They include armoured, reconnaissance, infantry,  and\nat\ntack and reconnaissance aviation units.\n•Combat Support  force elements provide operational assistance; including fire  and\nm\nanoeuvre support to Combat force elements. They are: helicopters, artillery,\ncombat engineers, intelligence, communications, command support and informati on\nops sp\necialists.\n•Combat Service S upport  is the organisational support provided to the whole force,\nprimarily in the fields of administration, logistic , health service support , equipment\nsupport  & infrastructure .\n8.7. Force type .  Complementary to functional categorisation, land forces are also \nclassified by their force type or specialist capability, commonly described in NATO as:  \n•Heavy - armoured vehicles that maximise firepower and protection, a compromise is\nmade with operational and tactical mobility.\n•Medium  - equipped with armoured vehicles that are optimised for long ran ge\nm\nanoeuvre but still have some valuable protection and firepower .\n•Light  - dismounted light forces have limited firepower and intrinsic protection. Yet\nthey can theoretically go anywhere that human beings can go – into mountains,\nforests, marshes, buildings, caves or subterranean structures\n•ISR Forces; Air Manoeuvre Forces; Amphibious ; Mountain\n8.8.

Recce Role .  To provide accurate, timely and continuous information to the force by \nday and night, in all weathers and across all military activities. \n8.10.  Recce Tasks .  Operating in advance of a unit or force, recce unit tasks include:  \na. Find.   Finding by the use of:\n• Surveillance.\n• Scouting.\n• Reconnaissance.\n• Raiding. (This could be considered strike  – but recce forces are not\ngenerally optimised to conduct strike operations and are better suited to\nthe find function which can then allow other elements to conduct strike).\n• Key leader engagement.\nb. Security  (through Find  and Fix normally with other assets, artillery and gui ded\nw\neapons for example).  Protecting the main body, when grouped with direct and\nindirect fire assets, can be used to delay an enemy advance or protect a flank.  Tasks\ninclude:\n• Screening.\n• Guarding.\n• Covering Force.\nc. Exploit .   Exploit by pushing on through gaps in defences, pursui ng a\nw\nithdrawing opponent or engaging a high value target.\n8.11.  Types  of Recce.  The equipment of reconnaissance units tends to match the \nformation for whom they work.  In the UK there are some specialist assets eg chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, as well as tracked, wheeled and light reconnaissance \nunits which, for historical reasons, are part of the Armoured Corps.  Commanders may group recce assets, and these can be task organised to other units and formations as required:  \n• Aviation reconnaissance, provided by battlefield helicopters.\n• Armoured reconnaissance (tracked) for armoured infantry/tank brigades an\nd\nd\nivision.\n• Mechanised reconnaissance (wheeled) for mechanised brigades and\ndivisions.\n• Light reconnaissance for light infantry brigades and divisions can be draw n\nf\nrom infantry units and task organised as required, f example parachute or\ncommando recce forces.• Special forces, who can do some recce tasks but are tasked at the strategic\nlevel.\n8.12.  Recce Planning Considerations . \na. Early tasking .   Reconnaissance units might be tasked after Step 1 of\n an\nes\ntimate if critical information requirements are identified, the lack of which will hol d\nup pl\nanning.\nb. Stealth .  The British reconnaissance philosophy traditionally espouses “recc e\nby\n stealth” (although the new UK Strike Brigade concepts may change this).  They\nare currently not best equipped to conduct recce by fire and would need reinforci ng\ns\nhould they be asked to do so.\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 c.

Although they will take all they need with them for a limited time,\ncovert and/or long -range  re-supply may be required by tasking separate joint forc e\nel\nements.\nARMOURED (TANK)  UNITS  \n8.13.  Tank Roles.  The primary role of armour is destruction of the enemy by offensive \naction.  The components of this are:  \na. Shock action .   Shock action is the sudden, concentrated application of\nviolence on an enemy from an unexpected direction. It is the combined effect of\nsurprise, mobility and firepower concentrated in time and space. By attacking i n\ns\ntrength at a weak spot at an unexpected moment and from an unexpected direction,\nan armoured force can destroy large numbers of the enemy. Shock action c an\npar\nalyse the enemy, helping to seize the initiative. Shock action can be particularly\neffective if it can be achieved at night or at a place that the enemy thinks is secure.Like surprise, the effects of shock action may be transient and local. It shoul\nd be\nex\nploited vigorously.\nb. Aggressive mobile action to destroy enemy armour .   Arguably the primary\ncomponent, tanks are there to kill enemy tanks.  The tank’s mobility, survivability,durability and flexibility combined with the firepower to destroy enemy armouraccurately whilst on the move, gives it the leading role in the des truction of enemy\narmoured fighting vehicles and strong points during the advance and withdrawal.Above this level it should be noted that increasingly armour is being supplemented by\nattack helicopters. Tanks provide the mobile element of the anti -armour plan i\nn\ndef\nence and should be concentrated and used offensively in the support of the\npositional element.\nc. Close combat in conjunction with infantry.   The presence of main battl e\nt\nanks adds momentum, reduces casualties, significantly enhances direct precisi on\nf\nirepower as well as boosts friendly force morale. When considering the COE, armour\ncan be task organised in a more flexible manner and in smaller groupings (minimum\nof a pair of tanks) to meet the specific mission/environmental requirements.\nd. Surveillance, target acquisition & reconnaissance (STAR) . The sighti ng\ns\nystems on armoured vehicles provide a protected, constant and all- weather STAR\ncapability, including thermal imaging and elevated fields of view.\n8.14.  Tank Tasks.  The following are likely tasks for armour within each function of the \nLand Tactical Framework (Find, Fix Strike and Exploit):    \n• Find.   Stand -off overwatch or recce by combat/fire.\n• Fix.   Fix by the use of own weapons as well as by indirect fire support\n• Strike.   By one of the 3 roles listed above.\n• Exploit.   By the use of their mobility and shock action.\n8.15.  Tank Planning Factors.  \na. Characteristics.   The characteristics of a tank are:\n• Firepower/lethality\n• Mobility/manoeuvre\n• Protection/survivability\n• Durability\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Flexibility\nb. Tank Employment Guidance: When employ ing armoured units, commanders  \nmust ensure that they use tanks aggressiv ely to exploit their full potential, particularly  \nfirepower and mobility.  The s hattering effect of armour against an enemy is  \nmaximised when tanks are c oncentrated, and therefore armour generally should be  \nused in the greatest numbers possible (COE dependent), and employed on  \nconsecutive rather than concurrent tasks. Even in defens ive operations, the tank will  \nbe us ed offens ively to defeat an attacker. In offensiv e combined arms operations, it  \nwill normally be armour that takes the lead in the break-i n and exploitation of initial  \nsuccess handing over to infantry as necessary.  Due to these characteristics, tank \norganisations are the primary manoeuvre or strike arm.  Further planning factors  \ninclude:\nc. Real estate.   In an offensiv e role, tanks need sufficient manoeuvre space in  \norder to use their mobility to best effect, which enhances surprise and protection.  In a \ndefensive posture, dispersal assists survivability; the rule of thumb being 1 squadron / \ncompany = 1 km².\nd. Signature (size, weight, noise, dust and thermal).   The presence of tanks is  \nhard to conceal.  Effort, imagination, s pace, cover and skilful driving are required to  \nminimise the chanc es of detection by  the enemy . The size, noise levels and  \npresence, however, can be used to intimidate an adversary as a s how of strength or  \nas part of a dec eption plan.\ne. Close quarter fighting.   Armour is excellent at creating entry points, breaching \nobstac les, des troying s trong points, carrying combat supplies, protecting infantry , \nproviding a communications platform, and providing devastating direct fire. However, \nat close quarters, armour has blind spots and can be vulnerable to dismounted \nadvers aries. In close country (such as forests) or built-u p urban areas, armour is \nparticularly v ulnerable due to high angle threats and restrictions to mobility, which \nresult in channelling and restricted arcs.  To counter the constraints of fighting in \nurban or close country armour can be used to great effect if grouped as a minimum in \npairs and combined with infantry.\nf. Obstacles.   Natural and artificial obstacles can restrict armour’s mobility and if  \ndeliberately canalised, armour can become vulnerable and a tempting target to an  \nadvers ary’s  anti-t ank, air and aviation weaponry.  However, they may often be able to  \novercome obstacles with the use of an attached bulldozer blade, engineer bridges  \nand the protection of infantry.\ng. Ground holding capability.  Tank s can deny ground by  the application of fire,  \nbut they cannot, by themselves , hold ground agains t a determined dismounted  \nenemy . This requires the intimate support of infantry.\nh. Sustainment.   The logistic demands  of fuel, oil, spares, and general  \nmaintenance for tanks are considerable. For example, the fuel us ed by  a British  \nChallenger 2 squadron (18 tanks) operating across country for 1 day is 12,600 litres,  \nrequiring 3 x  fuel tankers.  In addition, whilst equipment is capable of operating 24  \nhours per day, crews  are not. Sensible use of notice to move times is  essential to  \npermit adequate crew rest, time for maintenance and battle procedure. Additional \nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 logistic challenges are created when armour is grouped with a non- tank unit not used \nto providing specialist maintenance and  ammunition.  \nINFANTRY UNITS  \n8.16.  Infantry Role .   To close with and defeat the enemy through close combat. \n8.17.  Infantry Tasks.  \na. Find.   Infantry collects information on adversaries, the ground, human terrai n\nand t\nhe environment through patrolling, supplemented by surveillance devices the\nhuman element of this gives them a persistent/24 -hour, all weather capability as well\nas make them ideal to gain information by speaking with local people.\nb. Fix.   Infantry fixes the enemy by denying him freedom of manoeuvre, whether\nby seizing terrain, manoeuvre or through deception operations, supported by a\nbattalion’s direct and indirect weapon systems, particularly those within its fir e\ns\nupport groups.\nc. Strike .   All infantry units strike the enemy through close, usually dismounted,\ncombat.  The infantry battalion is organised to deliver small scale area suppressi on\nw\nith its organic mortar platoon and accurate fire from direct fire weapons such as\nJAVELIN, HMG,  GMG, GPMG, and sniper and sharpshooter rifles.\nd. Exploit .   Infantry is able to exploit fleeting opportunities, particularly in complex\nterrain where armoured vehicles are restricted.  Combined arms groupings are themost effective grouping to exploit a situation, and must be in the first part of anexploitation force to seize, hold and expand an opportunity.\n8.18.  Types  of Infantry .   \na. Armoured infantry .   Armoured infantry are equipped with armoured infantry\nfighting vehicles to provide high mobility, protection and firepower, they enabl\ne\ni\nnfantry units to get onto the enemy position and fight using the vehicle as part of the\nclose combat system.  Armou red infantry is often employed alongside or with armour.\nb. Mechanised infantry.   Mechanised infantry use armoured personnel carriers\n(tracked or wheeled) to get to an area of combat before dismounting to conduct t he\nt\nask.  They often provide a fixed defensive point around which an enemy c an be\nc\nhannelled or our own armoured forces can manoeuvre and strike.\nc. Light infantry .   Light infantry are equipped with only light scales and no\narmoured vehicles, they self -deploy by foot carrying all their equipment.  Their\nlightness allows them to operate in the most complex terrains such as mountains,jungles and urban areas and make s them well suited to rapid strategic deployment.\nSpecialist light role infantry (such as parachute or commando units) may us\ne\ns\neparate insertion techniques such as air assault (para and TALO), vertical assault\n(mountain or sea cliffs) or amphibious assault from the sea.\n8.19.  Infantry Planning factors.   Infantry are able to operate continuously across all \ntypes of terrain and in all climatic conditions.  They can operate independently (as they are \ntactically self- sufficient) or as part of a combined arms grouping.  They can also be delivered \nby land, sea or air.  The infantry is the primary ground holding arm.  \nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 a.

Attack Aviation Role.   Attack aviation units provide the core element of air \nmanoeuvre (primarily through their offensive action role).  \n8.21.  Attack Aviation Tasks.  \na. Offensive action.   Offensive action involves the delivery of firepower, usually\nas part of the combined arms battle. The Apache is the main  platform for deliveri ng\nhel\nicopter weapons, whether as a discreet combat manoeuvre element, or i n\nc\nombination with other ground- based assets, such as air assault infantry or armour.\nHowever, armed light battlefield helicopters can provide fire support.\nb. Control and direction of fire power .   Aircrews offer a unique capability i n\nhel\nping to de- conflict, control and direct firepower from multiple sources includi ng\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 artillery, mortars, Naval Gunfire Support and ground attack aircraft. Aircrew are \nfrequently trained to operate as air observation posts for artillery and as forward air controller (airborne) for the control of other rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft. ( Find  \nand Fix or Strike ) \nc. Command Support . Command support covers a range of tasks, centred \non\nt\nhe movement and situational awareness of commanders, and the provision of vital\ncommunication links in the absence of a fully established ground network. Typically\nthese fall to light utility helicopte rs since they require a low signature aircraft, capable\nof operating to and from confined temporary/ad- hoc landing sites. Command support\ntasks include provision of an airborne command post, passage of information, or\nallowing a commander to  get around the battlefield.\nd. RECCE/ ISTAR .   Battlefield helicopters and light fixed wing aircraft mak e\nex\ncellent airborne ISTAR platforms and must be effectively incorporated into the\ncollection plan. Aircrew deliver live and valuable information to ground commandersas the tactical situation develops. Battlefield helicopter capability is mainly focused atthe tactical level, where it integrates and is layered with other collection assets,\nparticularly covering terrain that cannot be observed by ground- based assets.\nHowever , battlefiel d helicopter capabilities degrade with environmental and climatic\nconditions. Tasks include:\n• Aviation screen tasks to observe, identify and report information to\nground or aviation forces. It provides a manoeuvre commander with the means\nto cover flanks, dead ground and other areas of specific interest and,\ndepending on the aircraft equipment available, can be provided by both day\nand night in both an overt and covert manner.\n• Secondary observation tasks, where aircraft can often supply useful\ninformation when they are engaged on other tasks. For example, aircraft\nengaged on a screen or guard task can continue to observe and collect\ninformation whilst moving to and from their pr imary mission.\ne. Tactical mobility.   Tactical mobility involves the movement of force elements\nand materiel, provided mainly by medium and heavy -lift battlefield helicopters.\nBattlefield helicopter tactical mobility tasks are at the heart of air manoeuvre, air\nassault and amphibious operations, and include troop movement, deploymentartillery, air defence and combat engineer support, CASEVAC and logistic re- supply.\n8.22.  Attack Aviation Planning Factors .   Principal planning factors include:  \na. Environmental factors (loiter capability) .   The lift capacity and endurance of\nhelicopters could vary significantly according to the season and location.Environmental constraints, which restrict pilots’ visibility and helicopter activity, areweather, poor illumination or dust obscuration of landing sites.  In addition, high heat\nand altitude can reduce the load and range of an aircraft.\nb. Aircraft endurance.   Balancing fuel requirements with weapons, passengers,\nor freight affects aircraft endurance. In general, the greater the payload the less fuel\nwill be available, and the range or time available on task is consequently reduced.Additionally, more time will have to be taken transiting to and from fuel sites thoughlimitations are often reduced by the use of forward arming and re- fuelling points.\nSERIAL 1-01–08 \n1–01-08 – 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 c. Vulnerability.   Helicopters are vulnerable to ground fire as well as air defenc e\ns\nystems.  To reduce vulnerability, helicopters must maximise the agility and mobility\nof the aircraft.  In air assault operations, commanders must consider the vulnerability\nof a land site’s location against pay off. For example, a landing site which is off -set\nfrom the target may pose less risk to the aircraft than the assaulting troops who must\ncover more ground to reach the objective. However, a landing site closer or on th e\nobj\nective may increase the risk to the aircraft (and the troops within them) but the\nchances of mission success may be greater.\nd. Sustainability.    Helicopters require a high level of maintenance, whic h\ni\nncreases with usage, and is costly in terms of resources.\nSERIAL 1–01–09 \n1–01–09 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 THE AIR (& SPACE)  COMPONENT  \nReference: JDP 0 -30 (3rd Edition Dated Sept 2022) . Also See Serial 4 -01-05 Air Doctrine \nFundamentals . \n9.1. Air Power .  Air power is defined as: the ability to use air capabilities  in and from the \nair, to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events .  Air power is truly global in \nnature as it theoretically enables access to any point on Earth, be it over land or sea using \nits enduring attributes of height , speed and reach .  Air power offers policy makers an agile, \ntimely and focussed capability that can be highly effective in resolving or averting a \ndeveloping crisis.  The use of air power can also potentially negate the requirement to \ndeploy a larger force over a broader timescale by land or sea.   \n9.2. Space Power .  Space power is defined as: exerting influence in, from, or through, \nspace. Like air power, the attributes of space power are related to the ability to exploit the \nvertical dimension.  The vast majority of military operations could not be sustained without  \nspace capabilities.  Operations  are dependent on space, principally for communications, \nmeteorological, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) functions, as well as for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR).  \n9.3. The Air Component .  The Air Component Headquarters (AC HQ) normally has an \nembedded Joint Air Operations Centre (JAOC), which may be static, or deployable \ndepending on the nature and scale of joint air operations.  In a coalition setting this is becomes a Combined Air operations Centre (CAOC). The AC HQ and JAOC may be sea or \nland- based and even transition between locations should the situation dictate; for example, \nduring the build- up and draw down phases of a joint campaign, or when his command & \ncontrol ( C2) or command & control system ( C2S) capability is threatened. The \nresponsibilities of the Air Component Commander (ACC) are assigned by the Joint Task \nForce Commander and usually include:  \n•Developing a Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP).\n•Recommending apportionment of joint air assets to the JTFC.\n•Allocating and tasking joint air assets based on the JTFC’s air apportionmentdecision.\n•Overseeing, guiding, integrating and adjusting the execution of Joint Air operations incoordination with the JTFC and affected Component Commanders.\n•Evaluating the results of Joint Air operations and forwarding assessments to the\nJTFC to support the overall assessment effort.\n•Providing and receiving appropriate liaison officers (LOs).\n•Performing the duties of the airspace control authority (ACA).\n•Performing the duties of the air defence commander (ADC).\n•Functioning as a supported or supporting commander.\n•The ACC may also be nominated as the Space Coordinating Authority (SCA).\n9.4. Airspace Control Authority (ACA) .  The ACA has the overall responsibility for \nestablishing and operating an appropriate airspace control system through an Airspace \nControl Plan (ACP). The ACP is developed in consultation with the JFC, the other \ncomponents, and the HN where appropriate, in order to integrate, coordinate or deconflict all \nairspace user requirements.  \nSERIAL 1–01–09 \n1–01–09 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 9.5. Air Defence Commander (ADC) .  The ADC is responsible for integrating the Air \nDefence (AD) assets of joint components into a coherent Joint Air Defence Plan (ADP). This \nincludes establishing weapons control procedures and measures for all Defensive Counter -\nAir (DCA) weapon systems and forces, coordinating with regional and/or HN Ground Based \nAir Defence (GBAD)  systems, and exchanging information necessary to support civil \ndefence activities.   An example of layered air defence is illustrated below in figure 9 .1; \nshowing a mixture of air and ground based assets.  In addition to the weapon systems, there \nwould also be air and ground based radars and C2 elements:  \n9.\n6. Space Coordinating Authority (SCA) .  SCA is normally held by the J TFC, but may \nbe delegated to a subordinate commander, as appropriate. The SCA is responsible for \nfacilitating unity of effort across  national and military space capabilities in support of joint \noperations.  He does  this by gathering operational requirements across the joint force and \ndeveloping a prioritised list of space requirements based on JFC objectives.   The SCA’s task \nis challenging because space assets (by their nature) are  considered  strategic assets (few in \nnumber and many capable of servicing multiple theatres/operations in each pass). C2 and \nexecution authority is  usually centralised with the asset owner/operator, and it would be \nunusual for  responsibilities to be delegated; therefore, the SCA must coordinate for their use \nthrough agreed C2 relationships.  \nFigure 9.1: An example of layered air defence  \nSERIAL 1-01-10 \nTHE MARITIME COMPONENT  \nReference: JD P 0-1- UK Maritime Power ( 5th Edition dated O ct 2017) . \nAlso See Serial 1-02-02 Maritime Doctrine Fundamentals. \n10.1. Maritime Power.  Maritime power is defined as: “the ability  to apply maritime \nmilitary  capabilities a t and from t he se a to influence the behaviour of act ors and t he course  \nof eve nts”.  Maritime power i s not only appl ied in the m aritime domain but al so across  the \nother domains a s well.  In the physi cal se nse the maritime domain comprises  the hi gh seas,  \nexclusive economic zo nes and territorial se as.  Maritime forces are those  oper ating at or \nfrom t he sea.  \n10.2. The M aritime Component ( MC).  The M C provides a broad, agi le and scalable \ncapability,  which can ope rate w ithin all environments from the open ocean t o the littoral, and \nacross  beni gn to co mbat co nditions.   It ca n also enable the delivery or i ntegration of Land \nComponent and Special Forces C omponent asse ts and st aging of ai r ope rations.   Maritime \noperations i nclude any a ctions pe rformed by surface, s ubsurface and/or maritime air f orces \nto gain or exp loit se a control o r sea deni al and/ or to project  pow er from the sea.  Sea control \nmay al so include naval c ooperation and gui dance  of sh ipping, p rotection of the sea l ines of \ncommunication, bl ockades or em bargoes agai nst economic or m ilitary sh ipping and maritime \ninterdiction operations.  This i ncludes  oper ations to locate, cl assify and track  surface  \nvessels,  submarines and ai rcraft and, i f required, applying force  agai nst them.  Amphibious  \noperations  with their i nherent f lexibility i ncrease  the commander’s opt ions f or manoeuvre. \n10.3. Command and C ontrol (C2) .  The M aritime C omponent C ommander (MCC) has  a \nplanning function withi n the J oint Ta sk Force HQ t hat p rovides maritime input t o the \ncampaign plan, but his p rimary f unction is t o exercise maritime command at t he tactical \nlevel.

The l ocation ultimately \nselected for t he M CC a nd his s taff w ill be driven by operational i mperatives.   When af loat, a \nsuitably co nfigured ship can meet all t he MCC’s  planning and execution n eeds,  particularly \nrobust  communications,  but al so, provide high levels of force protection.   \n10.4.

It al so states t he co mmand relationships w hich will apply on \ntermination of the amphibious oper ation.

Structure .  The  principal formation for maritime forces is the Maritime Task Force.  \nEach Task F orce is assigned a commander  who may either report directly to the Maritime \nComponent Commander (MCC)  or may be dually appointed as the MCC in which case he \nwill report directly to the Commander of the Joint Task Force (CJTF).  The Commander (of \nthe) Task Force (CTF) may further subdivide the Task F orce into Task Groups  and Task \nUnits to exercise command and control at the tactical level.  Each of these sub- formations \nwill be assigned a commander: a CTG will command a Task Group and a CTU will command a Task Unit.  These sub- formations  may be organise d based on capabilities, \ntasks , geography, or a combination of all three.   Each sub- formation will comprise a number \nof Task Elements (individual ships or submarines).  The 4 levels of maritime command are:  \n•Task Force (TF)  – the ships and submarines that collectively comprise a\ndiscrete, usually multi- capability, maritime force with forces assigned t\no\nf\nulfil specific missions  and tasks  as part of the force generation process .\n•Task  Group (TG)  – the ships and / or submarines that comprise a task or\ncapability -oriented formation within a Task Force.\n•Task Unit (TU)  – the ships and / or submarines allocated a specific task or\nrole from within a Task Group.\n•Task Element (TE)  – individual ships or submarines allocated to a Task\nForce.\n10.\n6. The Maritime Task Force.  Figure 10.2 shows a representative Maritime Task \nForce (TF 333).  TF 333 comprises 4 Task Groups:  an Amphibious Group to project power \nashore and a Carrier Group  to deliver Carrier Strike in  both the counter -sea and counter -land \nroles, and to provide air defence to the task force .  The role of the Advance Force  is to \nprepare the landing ground for the Amphibious Group and to clear choke points of mines.  Submarines deliver maritime fires , contribute significantly to intelligence, situational \nawareness and reconnaissance (ISR) and are the task force ’s most capable anti-submarine \nand anti -surface ship warfare platforms in which capacity they contribute significantly to Sea \nControl .  This is not the only way in which a task force can be put together and it assumes \nthat CJTF has delegated Operational Control (OPCON) of the individual platforms to the \nMCC.  \n10.7.  Escorts and Logistic Shipping .  Within TF 333, the escorts are included as a \nsingle Task Unit within the Carrier Group to  provide both Above Water and Anti -submarine \ndefence to the entire task force  as well as contributing to Maritime Fires .  In a Task \nOrganisation such as the one illustrated here, escorts would most likely b e ‘detached’ from \nthe Escorts TU to provide cover for the Advance Force and to the Amphibious Group, in \nwhich case they would be attached to the receiving formation.  Similarly, logistic shipping would be ‘detached’ from the Logistic Shipping TU and ‘attached’ to support these \nformations.  \nFigure 10. 1 Symbols for \nMaritime Groupings\nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Figure 10.2 – Maritime Task Force Diagram (Task Force 333)  \n10.8.  Maritime Air .  Ideally both air defence and maritime patrol aircraft will be available \nfrom land- based air, but this cannot be relied upon in all situations (eg, the Falklands Conflict \nof 1982 where the task force in the JOA was outside the range of all friendly land- based \nfighter aircraft).  In situations when land- based air support is not available, aircraft embarked \nin the a ircraft carriers would  be employed to provide air defence , flying Combat Air Patrol s \n(CAPs) over the task force.   Aircraft carriers also operate Airborne Early Warning (AEW) \naircraft for ISR and providing C2 to strike missions.  \n10.9.  Carrier  Group.  A Carrier Group (in the United States Navy known as a Carrier \nBattle Group)  will comprise:  \n•Aircraft Carriers  – CATOBAR / VSTOL Carriers1.\n•Submarines  – A nuclear -powered attack submarine (SSN) will invariably be\nat\ntached to the Carrier Group in either the Direct Support or Associated Support\nroles.  (See Para 10.20 ).\n•Escorts:\n–Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) escorts (Frigates / Corvettes) .\n–Anti Air Warfare (AAW) escorts (Destroyers or AEGIS Cruisers) .\n–Anti Surface Warfare (ASuW) ships (All Surface -to-Surface Missile (SSM) or\nmedium calibre gun (115 mm / 127 mm) equipped escorts) .\n1 Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Assisted Recovery (CATOBAR); Vertical / Short Take Off and \nLanding (VSTOL) – refer to Chapter 2: Naval Ships and Submarines.  \n\nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Logistic Shipping :\n–Fuel Tankers .\n–Stores Ships .\n–Miscellaneous logistic shipping such a Forward Repair Ship or Primary Casualty\nReceiving Facility ( Ship).\n–Ships Taken Up from Trade (STUFT) including bulk tankers and containervessels.\nA Flag Officer would be embarked in the most capable aircraft carrier as the Commander of \nthe Carrier Group (CTG 333.3).  He may also fulfil the role of Commander of the Task Force (CTF 333).  \n10.10.  Amphibious  Group.  An Amphibious Group will comprise:  \n•Amphibious Shipping:\n–Specialist Amphibious Transports – Landing Platforms Dock and Helicopter\n(LPD / LPH), and other Dock Landing Ships and specialist amphibious shipping.\n–Ships Taken Up From Trade – Roll On Roll Off (RoRo) ferries, passenger liners,\ncontainer ships etc .\n•The Landing Force  – soldiers, marines and their vehicles and other equipment\nembarked in both STUFT and specialist amphibious shipping.\n•Tailored Air Group  – Attack Helicopters (AH) and Support Helicopters (SH).\n•Escorts – ASW, AAW and ASuW ships may be detached to escort the A TG if th\ne\nTas\nk Force is not sailing as a single force.\n•Logistic Shipping  – specialised logistic shipping and STUFT may form part of the\nATG or may need to be detached to support the ATG.\nAs with the Carrier Task Group, a Flag Officer is likely to be embarked as the Commander of the Amphibious Task Group (COM ATG / CTG 333.1).  A General Officer will normally be appointed as Commander of the Landing Force (CLF). \n10.11.  Advance Force.  The Advance Force comprises the specialist shipping required to \nprepare the beaches and their approaches for an amphibious landing.  The Advance Force \nwill comprise: \n•Mine Counter Measures Vessels (MCMVs)  – Mine Hunters (MH) and Mi\nne\nS\nweepers (MS) .\n•Survey Ship  – for Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) of the littoral areas .\n•Support Ship – to support the MCMVs up threat with logistic and maintenanc e\nf\nacilities (could be the Survey Ship utilised for the REA or another platform) .\n•Escorts – escorts may need to be detached to protect the Advance Force  which  will\nus\nually have a slower SOA (Speed of Advance or passage speed) than the main task\nfor\nce.\nThe Commanding Officer (CO) of the survey ship will normally act as the Commander of the \nAdvance Force Task Group (CTG 333.2) and as the MCM Commander.  \nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 10.12.

Other Task Forces could include conventional submarines (SSKs) but these \nwill be limited in their endurance and SOA . \nFORMATION AND SUB -FORMATION NUMBERING \n10.13.  Task Force.  Because, by definition, a maritime Task Force is an organisation \ncreated for a particular operation, it will be assigned a unique number for that  operation. \nUnited Kingdom, United States and NATO -led coalitions tend to use a 3-figure number such \nas ‘3 -3-3’ as in Task Force 333 illustrated here.  \n10.14.  Task Group.  Within a particular Task Force, its Task Groups will be sequentially  \nnumbered taking the number of the parent formation and separating the sub- formations  by a \ndecimal point.   The Task Groups in Task Force 333 will therefore be  numbered 333.1 \nonwards.  \n10.15.  Task Units .  Task Units will take the number of the parent Task Group, say  Task \nGroup 333.1, and follow a similar process. Within Task Group 333.1, the Task Units will be \nnumbered 333.1.1, 333.1.2 etc.  \n10.16.  Task Elements.  Each Task Element will have its own unique number assigned \nfollowing a similar process so that the ships within Task Unit 333.1.1 will be sequentially \nnumbered 333.1.1.1, 333.1.1.2 and so on. Once a ship or  submarine has been assigned a \nnumber as a Task Element with a Task Force,  this number will not change regardless of \nsubsequent tasking.  \n10.17.  Levels of Command.  Not every ship will be assigned to a Task Unit or even to a \nTask  Group.  In the Task Force 333 example, the submarines are part of Task Group 333.4 \nbut are not assigned to a Task Unit.  \n10.18.  Maritime Air .  For the purposes of the exercises at the MAJCSC, the strike and air \ndefence aircraft embarked in the carriers will be assigned to the joint air planning process.  \nWhat this means in simple terms is that they will be tasked by the Air Component \nCommander and not the MCC.  Organic helicopters in the escorts remain under the tasking \nauthority of the MCC through his subordinate commanders.  In reality, only a proportion of the carrier -borne aircraft would be assigned to the joint air planning process; the remainder \nremaining under the OPCON of the MCC.  \nATTACHMENTS AND DETACHMENTS  \n10.19.  When Task Org -ing in the land domain , sub -units may be detached from one unit or \nformation and attached to another to deliver an all -arms capability.  The sub- units that move \nare known as attachments and detachments or ‘atts and dets’ and the process is called battlegrouping.  A similar proc ess may be used in the maritime domain when ships with \nspecific capabilities may be detached from one formation and attached to another.  For \nexample:  \n• Amphibious Task Group.  If CTF 333 had a task to conduct an amphibious\noperation, escorts and logistic shipping would be detached from their original\nformations (TU 333.3.2 and TU 333.3.3) and attached to the ATG (TG 333.1).\nSERIAL 1-01-10 \n1–01–10– 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Advance Force.   Whenever an amphibious operation is planned, the Advance Force\n(TG 333.2) may need to operate independently in order to prepare the landi ng\ngr\nounds.  Cover will need to be provided by suitable detached escorts and logistic\nshipping in a similar manner as  for the ATG.\n• SLOCs Group.  If the CTF has a task to protect the Sea Lines of Communicati on\n(\nSLOCs), he might assign the task to the Carrier Group (TG 333.3) with the CTG\nundertaking the role of SLOCs Group Commander.  The carrier would nee d a\nnum\nber of the escorts to provide defence against the air, surface and sub- surface\nthreats as well as logistic shipping to support the group when detached from the mai n\nbody\n of the Task Force.\n10.20.  Nuclear Submarines .  The SSN attached to the Carrier Group will be in either the \nDirect Support (DS) or Associated Support (AS) role.  Direct Support means that the CTG of \nthe Carrier Group has TACOM of the submarine.  Associated Support is when TACOM is \nheld at a higher (Joint or national) level when the CTG will only be delegated TACON . \n10.21.  Ad Hoc  Formations.  On occasions it may be necessary to create new formations \nto conduct specific tasks.  For example, a Surface Action Group (SAG) is formed of \nspecialist escorts with the necessary logistic support to engage enemy surface or submarine forces in open waters.  A SAG would be formed as an independent Task Unit under the \ntactical command of the senior Commanding Officer of the warships forming the SAG.  The \nSAG would then be detached from the maritime task force main body to take the fight to the \nenemy.  The ‘surface’ in SAG refers to the situation in which the SAG operates and not the \nwarfare discipline of ASuW.  SAGs cannot contain either aircraft carriers of submarines. \nSERIAL 1-01-11 \n1–01-11 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 THE LOGISTICS COMPONENT  \nReference: JDP 4 -00 Logistics for Joint Operations  (4th Edition July 2015)  \nAlso See Serial 1- 02-06 Joint Logistics Doctrine Fundamentals . \n11.1.  The Logistic Component ( LogC ).  A LogC  provides the focal point for logistic \nsupport and optimum means of controlling logistic assets spread across components.  While \ncomponent logistics are focused forward  to deployed units , the LogC  not only looks forward \nto provide logistic support to them , but also looks back to monitor the logistic activities of the \nstrategic base.  A LogC  is likely to be deployed when the scale or complexity of the \noperation exceeds the capacity of JTFHQ J1/J4 staff.  The LogC  undertakes the more \npractical aspects of operational and tactical logistics, allowing JTFHQ J1/J4 staff to \nconcentrate on critical campaign logistic factors.  \n11.2.  Role .  The LogC  delivers coherent support to the JTF by taking responsibility for \nactivities of benefit to 2 or more components, coordination between components and the \nappropriate use of their logistic resources.  The LogC  will be responsible for the RSOM \nelement of Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI).  It will assist in \nthe integration process , but this is a J3- led activity.  The LogC  will sustain the RSOI \noperation.   It controls the theatre end of the coupling bridge and ensures that stocks arrive in \ntheatre and are distributed in accordance with the JTFC’s priorities.  A LogC  is not \nresponsible for the detailed management of component logistics but does exercise a \ncoordinating function to ensure that the JTFC’s priorities are met.  A LogC  may be allocated \na specified Area of Operations, for which it has force protection and other responsibilities.   If \nthis is not the case, close liaison with the headquarters performing this function is necessary. \nThe specific LogC  responsibilities are to:  \n•Command all logistic assets assigned to the LogC  in the JOA.  It contributes to the\nJTFHQ estimate process and liaises with coalition partners, deployed contractors\nand the host nation.\n•Coordinate in- theatre logistic support, in accordance with the JTFC’s priorities,\nthrough activation and maintenance of robust lines of communication.  Components\nretain command of their integral logistic assets, unless otherwise directed by theJTFC. However, to maximise efficiency, the LogC  is normally given coordinati\nng\naut\nhority.\n•Establish and manage the Recognised Theatre Logistic Picture, as part of the Joint\nOperating Picture.\n11.3.  LogC  Functions .  The Joint Force Logistic Component  is critical to preparing, \nprojecting, sustaining and recovering the JTF and carries out a range of specific functions in \nsupport of a deployed force:  \n•Theatre Activation.\n•Movement Control.  This includes mov ement into the JOA in accordance with the  \nJoint Desired Order of Arrival Staff Table (JDOAST).\n•Establishing In-T heatre Movement and Life Support. The LogC is res ponsible for  \ncoordinating intra-t heatre movement, including related life support. This normally  \nrequires joint control to optimise transport assets.\n•Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI). Reception,  \nStaging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI) is a c omplex joint C2 operation.  \nIt draws together the movements and administrative functions neces sary to move,  \nproces s, accommodate and provide life support to a transiting force. The RSOI \nelement is normally c ontrolled by the LogC HQ, in liaison with the JTFHQ.  Control of \nSERIAL 1-01-11 \n1–01-11 – 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 integration activity is likely to be primarily a component responsibility in conjunction \nwith the JTFHQ J3.  \n•Intra -Theatre Supply. The LogC  controls intra- theatre air transport and usually mai n\ns\nupply routes.\n•Logistic Support .  The LogC  exercises  coordination authority over all in- theatre\nlogistic assets, as well as command of those units which provide joint support.  Force\nlevel logistic support encompasses supply and distribution, movements,maintenance, infrastructure, provision of fuel, water, electrical power, temporarydeployable accommodation as well as medical and personnel administrative support.This support may be provided from own armed forces  or multinational sources, from\nthe host nation, from contractors or from other in country resources.\n•Force Supply and Distribution.  Supply and distribution units under command ofthe LogC  are responsible for the receipt, storage, control, maintenance, accounti\nng\nand di\nstribution of operational logistic stocks for environmental components, i n\nac\ncordance with the Joint Task Force Commander ’s priorities.\n11.4.  Logistic Command & Control .    Deploying a scalable, task -organised LogC  HQ \nenables logistic support between components to be coordinated. The headquarters has a \ndual role:  \n•Looking forward, to provide logistic support to the components in theatre;\n•Looking backward, to monitor and influence logistic activities from, and in the\nstrategic base . \nStrat HQ Log Staff:  \n•Determine the logistic feasibility of\noperations\n•Inform the Joint Task Force Commander(JTFC) where logistic vulnerabilities li\ne\nand w\nhere risks can be taken\n•Exploit logistic strengths and minimis e\nw\neaknesses arising from deployed forc e\nel\nements or assets, taking remedial\naction as necessary\nD evelop future plans, includin g\npr\noviding the logistic input t o\nr\nedeployment planningJTFHQ Log Staff:  \n•Sets the theatre logistic\npolicy\n•Establishes the logisticand movement priorities\nwithin the joint operationsarea;\nMon itors the recognised\ntheatre logistic pictureMilitary \nStrategic HQ  \nFigure 11. 1 Illustrating logistic command and control on an operation  \nSERIAL 1-01-12 \n1–01-12 – 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 THE SPECIAL FORCES COMPONENT  \n12.1.  The Special Forces Component .  The Special Forces Component Command \n(SFCC) is also known as the Special O perations  Component Command (SOCC)  in NATO .  \nSpecial operations are military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, \ntrained, and equipped forces using operational tactics, techniques, and modes of employment not standard to conventional forces.  These activities are conducted across the \nspectrum of conflict independently, integrated with, or in coordination with operations of conventional forces to achieve political, military, informational, and economic objectives.  Politico -military considerations may require low prominence, covert or discreet techniques, \nand the acceptance of a degree of physical and political risk not associated with \nconventional operations.  Special operations differ from conventional operations in degree of \nphysical and political risk, operational techniques, mode of employment, independence from \nfriendly support, and normally depend on detailed operational intelligence and indigenous \nassets.  \n12.2.  Role .  Special Forces have 3 main functions, which can be used in isolation or to \ncomplement one another:  \n•Surveillance and Reconnaissance. SF conduct covert ISTAR by land or sea in astatic or mobile role and can provide timely information to commanders at all levels.\n•Offensive Action. Offensive action is designed to achieve a focused effect with a\nminimum of unintended consequences.  Actions are directed against high val\nue\ns\ntrategic or operational targets, which may require covert  infiltration or specialist\ntechniques.  Offensive action may be conducted in patrol to multiple squadr on\ns\ntrength, independently or supported by  conventional forces.\n•Support and Influence .  Support and influence activities are often  conducted i n\ns\nupport of other government departments, usually as part of wider political or military\nobjectives.\n12.3.  Special Forces Component Commander’s Responsibilities .  Specific SFCC \nresponsibilities include:  \n•Acting as a JTFC in his own right drawing together elements from other components\nfor a SF- led operation.\n•Contributing to the JTFC’s estimate and developing, maintaining and implementi ng\nS\nF operations that best support the JTFC’s intent.\n•Acting as a supported or supporting component commander.\n•Providing functional advice to the JTFC on the correct employment of SF and\nc\nontributing to planning as appropriate.\n•Coordinating with the other component commanders to ensure unity of effort.\n•Exercising C2 of SF and other assets assigned by the JTFC.\n12.4.  Special Forces Component Headquarters (SFCHQ) Command & Control .  The \nSFCHQ is  normally deployed alongside a JTFHQ.  In multinational operations, it would form  \npart of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force, normally with a liaison party at \nthe JTFHQ.  The SFCHQ could be deployed independently but would require logistic support \nand has only a limited step- up capability.  \nSERIAL 1 -01-13 \n1–01-13 – 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 JOINT FORCE FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS – RELATED TO JOINT FUNCTIONS   \nReference: AJP -3 (Edition 3 Ver 1 + UK Ele  Feb 2023) Conduct of Operations (Annex B ) \n13.1.  What are Joint Force Functional Elements?   In any joint operation, the \ncommander joint task force (JTF) may choose from a wide variety of joint and service \nspecific capabilities and combine them in various ways to perform joint functions and \naccomplish the mission. The operation plan/order describes the way forces and assets are \nused together to perform joint functions and tasks. The following list is not exhaustive:  \n13.2.  Integrated Air and Missile Defence. Integrated air and missile defence is defined \nas all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile  threat or to nullify or reduce the \neffectiveness of hostile air action to protect  populations, territory and forces against the full \nspectrum of air and missile threats. The joint force air and missile defence commander is the \ncommander  with overall responsibility for air and missile defence; normally, the component  \ncommander with the preponderance of air and missile defence capability and the command, \ncontrol and communications capability to plan and execute  integrated air and missile \ndefence operations. They integrate and coordinate the air and missile defence assets of \neach force component into a coherent  joint air defence plan.  \n13.3.  Joint  Force Engineers  (JFEngr) .  Guided by the Joint Task Force Commander ’s \nCONOPS, the Joint Force Engineer controls all J oint Task Force Engineer assets and sets \ntheir priorities.   In particular, he should determine the balance between force support \n(enabling infrastructure) and combat support  (manoeuvre / protection) .  Joint Force Engineer \nstaff and force elements are likely to be some of the first enablers to deploy.  Subsequently, \nthe staff will be embedded within the JTFHQ.  \n13.4.  Joint  Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal  and Search (JFEOD) .  Joint explosive \nordnance disposal  and search is an operational explosive ordnance disposal /search \ncapability maintained by all 3 Services for use in their respective environments. However, \nenhanced synergy is achieved by C2 through the Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal Cell, \nfrom within the JTFHQ.   Often this is commanded by the JFEngr Commander.  \n13.5.  Joint  Helicopter Force .  A single joint helicopter force may be formed from \ncomponent  battlefield helicopters from the outset.  The Joint Helicopter Force Headquarters \nprovides a focus for the C2 of all battlefield helicopter force elements. The Joint Helicopter \nForce Commander may sit within the JTFHQ, in order to provide direct advice, or deploy \nwithin a stand -alone headquarters  or as part of the Air Component .   \n13.6.  Joint  Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear .  Joint Chemical, \nBiological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) elements provides CBRN protection support \nand C2 for operations.  It is an essentially modular organisation designed to address \ndifferent elements of the CBRN hazard and will be deployed on a threat based, task -\norganised basis. The headquarters elements, potentiall y with other multinational CBRN \nheadquarters, are likely to be located within the JTFHQ but could be subordinated to \ncomponent level . \n13.7.  Strategic Communication –  STRATCOM .   The STRATCOM function has four \nareas : STRATCOM, Information Operations, Psychological Operations and Media \nOperations.  The STRATCOM cell provides the central staff for the STRATCOM function.  It \nSERIAL 1 -01-13 \nreceives and interprets the STRATCOM directiv e which is part of the Strategic  Planning \nGuidance.  Information Operations  is a staff func tion to analys e, plan, integrate and assess \ninformation ac tivities to create desired effec ts on the will, understanding and capability of \nadvers aries, potential adversaries and audiences in support of mission objectives.  \nPsychological Operations or PsyOps are planned ac tivities  using methods of communication \nand other means directed at approv ed audiences in order to influence perc eptions, attitudes \nand behaviours, affec ting the ac hievement of political and military objectives.  Media \nOperations is the capability responsible for promoting military aims and objec tives by \ncommunicating acc urate and truthful information to internal and external audiences  in a \ntimely  manner. \n13.8.

What are the fundamentals of Joint doctrine?  There are a number of common \ndoctrinal ideas that  underpin all Joint military activity.  These are : \n•Fighting Power.\n•Principles of War .\n•Behaviour / Audience- centric Approach.   (Key Tenet)1\n•Manoeuvrist Approach.   (Key Tenet )\n•Mission Command.   (Key Tenet)\n•Doctrinal Frameworks .\nFighting Power  (from JDP 0 -01) \n1.2. Fighting power determines the ability of our Armed Forces to operate and warfight. \nFighting power’s hierarchy consists of a pre -eminent moral component2 (the will), a \nconceptual component (the thought process) and a physical component (the means). This is \nshown in Figure 1.1 .  \n1.3. Moral component .  The moral component concerns the ability to get people to fight :  \nUltimately, it is humans that generate fighting power.  The moral component of fighting \npower focuses on the Armed Forces ’ offensive spirit, initiative and a determination to \naccomplish the mission.   It comprises of 7 elements:   \n•Leadership .\nLeader\nship is a variabl e\nc\nombination of example,\npersuasion andcompulsion. It is t\nhe\npr\nojection of personality\nand purpose to influencesubordinates to prevail in\ndemandi\nng\nc\nircumstances.\nLeadership at all levels is\nthe principal element i n\nm\naintaining mo rale\n•Followership .\nFol\nlowership is the act or\ncondition of followi ng an\nappoi\nnted leader. G ood\nf\nollowership is as vital as\nstrong leadership, and its\nbenefits achieve unity ofpurpose.\n1 Key Tenet  = main principle of doctrine.  \n2 Note: AJP -01 Para 3.2 states  “There are three components of fighting power, none of which can \nclaim precedence and each mutually supports and informs the others .” Figure 1. 1  Illustrating the 3 components of fighting power.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • Culture .  Comprising complex traditions,  practices, organisational structures, \nartefacts and unwritten norms, our  cultures underpin effective fighting power and our \nwarfighting ethos.   But they  are also the cause of deep- seated behaviours and cognitive \nbiases across all  ranks  creating behaviours  such as groupthink, tribalism, ‘can- do’ \nmentality, presentism, cultural blindness, and consent and evade mindsets . \n• Warfighting ethos.   Warfighting ethos is the vital moral, emotional and spiritual \ncapacity to overcome fear and cope with the visceral and highly ambiguous nature of war; \nit is crucial to instilling courage and human resilience in our personnel who are required to \nfight.  \n• Moral cohesion.  Moral cohesion underpins the moral courage to fight and keep on \nfighting. It is built on shared experiences, a common sense of worth, discipline and \ncollective identity. It is sustained by shared common values and standards . \n• Motivation. Motivation is a product of training, confidence in equipment, leadership, \nmanagement, reward, welfare, discipline and mutual respect. Motivation and morale are \ninterdependent. Motivation can be affected by external influences (including public \nopinion), which can reassure or erode morale.  \n• Moral integrity .  Moral integrity provides the foundations upon which both cohesion \nand motivation are built and requires individuals to understand right and wrong. It is \ninstilled by personal discipline, education and training, and reinforced through the values \nand standards expressed by each Service.  \n1.4. Conceptual Component  (the ideas  & thought process):  The conceptual component \nprovides a framework of thinking within which military personnel can develop understanding about both their profession and the activities that they may have to undertake. It has \nrelevance at all levels of operations and depends on the development and exploitation of \nhuman qualities such as critical thinking, challenge, diversity of thought, foresight, resilience \nand adaptability . It comprises of 3 elements:  \n• Strategic analysis and assessment .  Strategic analysis and assessment is the \nanalysis of current and future trends and plausible outcomes to provide the context for \nlong- term decision- making. It informs and supports the development of Defence policy \nand capability . \n• Concept development .  Concept development is the application of a deliberate \nmethodology to  explore, understand and define Defence problems; determine possible \nsolutions that guide how forces will operate; and influence the policies and capabilities \nthat are required to enable the force to achieve success.  \n• Doctrine .  Doctrine is defined as: the fundamental principles by which military forces \nguide their actions in support of objectives. It is authoritative advice but requires \njudgement in application.   Doctrine can be simply described as considered thought on the \nbest way of doing things now . \n1.5. Physical  component  (generate the means to fight):  The physical component of \nfighting power  provides  the means to fight.   It has 5  elements:  \n• Personnel . Defence’s success depends on its people; they are the critical \ncomponent of Defence capability . \n• Equipment . A credible fighting force depends upon sufficient and effective \nequipment, optimised and scaled according to strategic direction.  \n• Training and collective performance.  Conditioning personnel for adversity and the \nchanging character of warfare begins with initial training and continues through \ndemanding collective training. This should entail the right balance of live and simulated \ntraining and match the character of the likely operating environments as closely as \npossible.   Collective performance is characterised by the high levels of cohesion, \nconfidence and proficiency achieved by units and formations that have trained or \noperated together.  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Sustainability . The ability to sustain operations is an essential element to generati ng\nc\nredible and effective fighting power and which affects the moral as well as the physical\ncomponent. As such it is a principle of war.\n•Readiness. Most armed  forces and supporting capabilities are at varying states of\nreadiness (routinely measured in days and hours) consistent with the assessed risks and\nthreats. Readiness is defined as: the period measured from an initiation order to t he\nm\noment when the headquarters or unit is ready to perform its task from its peacetime\nlocation (permanent or forward deployed) or ready for deployment.\nPrinciples of War  \n1.6. The principles of war reflect war’s enduring nature within the context of the changing \ncharacter of warfare and inform and guide the way in which we apply the military instrument. \nThe principles of war are not an exhaustive list, nor are they rules to be rigidly followed, but \nthey do provide comprehensive considerations for planning and executing campaigns and operations. Underpinned by understanding and the three tenets of doctrine, their expression, \nemphasis and application change in relation to context.  \n1.7. Except for selection and maintenance of the aim, placed first as the master principle, \nthe relative importance of each of the principles will vary according to context. Applying them \nrequires judgement, common sense and intelligent interpretation. The rapidly changing \ncharacter of warfare, driven by the pervasiveness of information and pace of technological \nchange, informs their contemporary relevance and, by extension, the evolution of two of the principles: ‘concentration of effects’ replacing ‘concentration of force’; and ‘integration’ \nreplacing ‘cooperation’.  \n1.8. The 10 principles of war  from JDP 0 -01 are summarised below . \nThe 10 Principles of War: ( JDP 0 -01 (6\nth Ed)) \n1. Selection and maintenance of the aim .  Regarded as the master principle of war,\nselection and maintenance of the aim provides focus. It enables military strategy and an\noutcome -focused execution at all levels of command. It is a reference point to assess\nprogress, prevents unnecessary activity and conserves resources .\n2. Maintenance of morale.   Maintenance of morale provides the will to fight. Hi gh\nm\norale is characterised by steadfastness, courage, confidence and sustained hope.\nMorale manifests itself as staying power and resolve, as well as the will to prevail despit e\npr\novocation and adversity.  It is a product of inspired political and military leadership; the\nlegitimacy of operations; a shared sense of purpose and values; well -being; confidence i n\nequi\npment; and training that forges fighting spirit, moral cohesion and calculated risk\ntaking without fear of failure.\n3. Offensive action.   Underpinned by fighting spirit, offensive action implies  a\nv\nigorous, incisive approach to exploiting opportunities and seizing the initiative. The\nprinciple of offensive action is reflected in assertive and confident campaigning thatconfronts threats early and proactively .\n4. Security .  Security entails balancing the likelihood of loss against achievi ng\nobj\nectives. Skill in command is, therefore, a foundation of security. It is a shield that c an\nhel\np conserve fighting power and affords freedom of action, when and where required to\nachiev e objectives. It demands managing risk, protecting high -value assets (including data\nand networks) and resilience\nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 5. Surprise .  Surprise, in its direct meaning, presupposes the unexpected. Whether \nachieved through physical or virtual methods, or a combination of both, surprise achieves \na cognitive effect –  a feeling of relative confusion, or perhaps shock –  that can undermine \nan opponent’s cohesion and morale.  \n6. Concentration of effect .  A commander must balance the concentrated delivery of \nlethal and non- lethal capabilities at critical points and times and increasingly at greater \nrange and dispersal to realise effect. This must be done in concert with other national \ninstruments  to generate the most appropriate blend of hard and soft power  \n7. Economy of effort .  Economy of effort may be described as the effective and \nefficient application of the components of fighting power: conceptual, moral and physical. \nCommanders must prioritise resources between all campaigns, operations and activities. \nEconomy of effort is best summarised as creating the right effect, in the right place, at the right time, with the appropriate resources . \n8. Flexibility .  Flexibility is the ability to change readily to meet new circumstances and \ncomprises the adaptability, versatility, resilience and responsiveness of the whole force –  \nboth mental and physical aspects. Really flexible organisations are highly responsive. \nResponsiveness is a measure of speed of action, reaction and of how quickly the initiative \ncan be seized or regained. Adaptability is an increasingly important aspect of flexibility. \nAdaptability is not solely adjusting to new external conditions or responding to \nadversaries; it is also about our ability to learn rapidly and respond to internal stimuli to \nchange.  \n9. Integration .  To integrate is to combine or be combined to form a whole. Integration \nhas an amplifying effect that must support and not hinder the adaptability of the force. It \nmay be likened to the connective tissue that knits all the parts of the force together whilst  \nretaining the benefit of diverse perspectives and approaches.  The effectiveness and \nefficiency of the force is improved through mutual trust and goodwill; a common aim; and \nintegration across operational domains and through strategic, operational and tactical \nlevels of operations. Integration is therefore closely associated with the principles of \nconcentration of effect and economy of effort.  \n10. Sustainability .  Sustainability of a fighting force is a critical enabler of fighting \npower’s moral and physical components and helps to enable freedom of action.   It is \nanchored on a resilient and capable strategic base at the heart of a global support \nnetwork.  Sustainability directly influences the tempo, duration and intensity of activities, \nand exploited effectively it allows constant pressure to lessen an adve rsary’s will to fight. It \nis an enabler of operational agility and reflects our preparedness and resolve, and therefore contributes to deterrence.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 NATO Principles of Joint and Multinational Operations  (AJP -01) \n1.9. NATO produce similar but slightly different version of the UK P rinciples of War.  \nThese are called the Principles of Joint and Multinational Operations.  They  are equivalent to, \nand closely aligned with, the UK  principles of war , however , there are some variances due to \ndifferent emphases.  \nThe 12 Principles of Joint and Multinational Operations (AJP -01 Para 3.69)  \nUnity of Effort.  Unity of effort emphasizes the requirement to ensure all means are \ndirected to a common goal. Military forces achieve this principally through unity of \ncommand. As part of a comprehensive approach, unity of effort binds all the parts of the \ncoalition together whilst retaining the benefit of diverse perspectives and approaches. It \nenables the integration and convergence of effects horizontally, across the Alliance and \npartners, and vertically, through the strategic, operational and tactical levels of operations. \nTo achieve such unity of effort, it is essential to plan, communicate and coordinate at all \nlevels and with all actors  involved in NATO activities and operations. It will require a \nflexible approach towards establishing shared objectives amongst NATO, partners, \ninternational organizations, non -governmental organizations, private sector and other \nstakeholders, based on the principles of civil- military interaction . \nDefinition of objectives . Operations must be focused towards clearly defined and \ncommonly understood objectives that contribute to attaining the end state. Understanding \nis central to providing insight and foresight to define effective objectives. Objectives must \nmaintain the legal and moral legitimacy of a campaign and the force. To ensure strategic \ncoherence the military instrument must be used proportionately and discriminately in \nrelation to other instru ments of power with an understanding that negative actions can \nhave serious political and strategic effects. By correctly selecting and defining objectives, \nit focuses the force on what is achievable and decisive, thereby supporting the principles \nof unity  of effort, freedom of action, concentration and economy of effort.  \nMaintenance of morale.  All forms of competition are human activity, with psychology \nbeing key to success and failure. Maintenance of morale provides the will to fight. High \nmorale is derived from fighting power and is characterized by steadfastness, courage, \nconfidence and sustained hope. Morale manifests itself as will and resolve, which will \ndrive the force to successfully achieve its objectives. It requires confidence in the \nsuperiority of information and equipment, inspiring leadership, tight cohesion and is \nsustained by the belief that the nation supports the force. It also demands freedom of \naction, taking and retaining the initiative, and controlling the narrative.  \nInitiative.  Competition involves the interplay between initiative and response. Achieving \nobjectives demands dictating the course of events in a competitive situation. To hold the \ninitiative is the ability to set or dictate the terms of action throughout the operation. \nMaintaining the initiative results in relentless cognitive pressure on the adversary, \ndegrading their morale and decision- making. Furthermore, it forces the adversary to \nrespond by trying to protect themselves; such a reactive posture is dif ficult to recover from \nand usually leads to defeat. Gaining the initiative requires relentless determination to succeed and an ability to impose one’s will on the adversary, to do the unexpected and \nachieve surprise and delegate the freedom of action for s ubordinates to exploit \nopportunities. Initiative is dependent on the other principles being applied in unison.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 6 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Freedom of action .  Freedom of action is minimizing restrictions to enable a subordinate \nto use their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity and judgement to achieve their \nobjectives. Freedom of action requires a disciplined offensive spirt and it enables the \nflexibility fo r subordinate commanders to make timely decisions within the context of their \nhigher commander’s intent. Rather than constantly awaiting further orders, freedom of action is a precondition for successfully maintaining and exploiting the initiative. Freedom  \nof action across all levels of command allows the force to adapt quicker to a rapidly \nchanging operating environment, and to deal with unforeseen problems that are inherent \nin operations. Training, mutual trust and understanding, simple plans and clear, c oncise \norders allows commanders to delegate the maximum freedom of action in line with their subordinates’ ability and the context of the mission.  \nOffensive spirit .  Offensive spirit delivers the benefits inferred by purposeful action rather \nthan inaction. Offensive spirit implies an incisive approach, with a willingness to understand and accept political and military risk, to seize, maintain and exploit the \ninitiative  in line with one’s freedom of action. Critically, offensive spirt does not preclude \ndefensive action. Central to offensive spirt is maintenance of morale and definition of objectives.  \nConcentration.  In an increasingly transparent and lethal operating environment it is ever \nmore difficult to maintain security and survival. Concentration is therefore not synonymous \nwith the physical massing of forces for a decisive action, but concentration of effects \ncreated from a dispersed force. Integrating and coordinating actions across the \noperational domains in concert with allies and partners will achieve mass. Through \nconcentration of actions and effects, it is possible to affect a rival’s capac ity for decision -\nmaking through imposing multiple dilemmas, gaining the initiative and achieving objectives, whilst also maximizing economy of effort. Effective concentration demands \nunity of effort, definition of objectives and the ability to sustain the mass.  \nEconomy of Effort .  Concentration must be delivered economically and precisely, \ntargeting the right objects in the right space at the right time with the appropriate \nresources. Of all the principles, it is the most difficult to apply due to its close \ninterdependence with t he ever -changing conditions of the operating environment. \nPrecision in the definition of objectives, surprise and security prevents wasted resource \nand effort by allowing the concentration of effort to be on what is decisive  \nSecurity.  Security limits vulnerability to hostile activities, threats and surprise. It is a \nshield that can help conserve fighting power and affords the initiative and freedom of \naction, when and where required, to achieve objectives. It requires unity of effort, \nunderstanding the points of influence, particularly vulnerabilities, risk management and \nresilience.  \nSecurity contributes to preparedness but does not demand  over-committing resources to \nguard against every threat or possibility, thereby diminishing relative fighting power.  \nLack of security, or a false interpretation of the principle of security, leads directly to being \nsurprised and loss of initiative. Commanders should anticipate the effects of being \nsurprised and make appropriate contingency plans to safeguard their freedom of action.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Surprise.  Surprise, achieved through unexpected actions, achieves a cognitive effect – a \nfeeling of relative confusion, or perhaps shock – that can undermine the adversary’s \ncohesion and morale. Using surprise is a significant way of seizing the initiative and may \nbe a critical  pre-condition for success. It is transient and must be exploited rapidly. \nDeception is closely related to surprise and requires deliberate measures to mislead targeted decision- makers into behaving in a manner advantageous to the ac hievement of \none’s objective. Surprise is also dependent on security.  \nFlexibility .  A flexible force is one that has the ability to be highly responsive to changing \ncircumstances. Plans and procedures should be sufficiently flexible to respond to the \nunexpected and they should empower commanders with maximum freedom of action. \nThis allows the force to adapt to a situation and learn lessons more quickly than a rival, \nthereby gaining the initiative. Flexibility is enabled by a clear definition of objectives, \nfreedom of action and sustainability.  \nSustainability.  Operations are demanding and often brutal and visceral, placing extreme \nphysical and psychological demands on personnel and requiring the constant care of \npeople and equipment. A force that lacks sustainability and resilience is rarely successful. \nPersonnel, equipment, systems and effects must be sustained and maintained to prevent \nculmination and to maintain resilience. The ability to generate and re -generate, avoiding \nshortages and waste, maintains a commander’s flexibility and freedom of  action to \nmaintain the initiative, while also inspiring confidence and enhancing morale.  \nThe Behaviour -centric / Audience- centric Approach  \n1.10.  A behaviour -centric / audience- centric approach recognises that people are at the \nheart of competition; it is their decisions and behaviours that determine how competition is conducted and resolved. A successful behaviour -centric / audience- centric approach begins \nwith commanders being clear about the outcome they seek; they need to study the audiences relevant to \nachieving the identified \noutcome and analyse \nthe effects they wish to \ncreate on those target \naudiences. Only then \nshould the mix of joint \ncapabi lities be \ndetermined to create physical, cognitive and \nvirtual effects across \nthe operational \ndomains to affect the \nunderstanding, \nphysical capability, will \nand cohesion of the \naudiences to achieve a \nsuccessful outcome.\n   \n1.11.  Activities can \nbe conducted by, with or through civil and \ncross government partners  in a \ncomprehensive approach. What is Public\nAn Individual, group or \nentity who are aware of \nactivities that may affect \nthe attainment of the end \nstate.\nStakeholders\nAn Individual, group or \nenity who can affect or is \naffected by the attainment \nof the end state.\nActors\nAn Individual, group or \nenity whose actions \nare affecting the \nattainment of the end \nstate.\nFigure 1 .2 The Three Categories that makeup an audience  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 important is for commanders and staff to work out how to orchestrate the joint force and, \nwhere required capabilities lie outside the joint force, synchronise all the relevant levers. \nUnderstanding the audiences is the major consideration.  \n1.12.  Audiences . An audience is: “ an individual, group or entity  whose interpretation of \nevents and subsequent behaviour may affect the attainment of the end state” .  Audiences \nare segmented into three general categories – public , stakeholders and actors – \ndepending on their ability to affect our outcomes. A sophisticated understanding provides the \nfocus for planning and executing activity to create or maintain the attitudes that constitute \nbehaviour. Commanders, with an understanding of the higher commander’s intent and the \nstrategic narrative, can then conduct target audience analysis to identify the effects that they \nwish to create.  \n•Stakeholder .  A stakeholder is an audience who can affect or is affected by the\nattainment of the end state. The Alliance’s activities encourage or develop supportiv e\ns\ntakeholders to become partners, whilst discouraging or denying unsupportive or hostil e\ns\ntakeholders from becoming actors.\n•Public.  A public is an audience who is aware of activities that may affect t he\nat\ntainment of the end state. Public’s attitude may range from hostile to supportive.\n•Actors .  An actor is an audience whose actions are currently affecting the attainment\nof the end state. The terms shown in the table below represent the spectrum  of actors\nthat is  commonly  used in doctrine.\nName  Description  of Actors  \nAlliance  The relationship that results from a formal agreement between two or more nations for broad, long- term objectives that further the common \ninterests of the members.  \nPartner  An actor belonging to a declared, presumed or recognized friendly \nnation, organization, faction or group sharing a common goal.  \nNeutral  An actor whose characteristics, behaviour, origin or nationality indicate \nthat it is neither supporting nor opposing either side.  \nRival  Actors who are competing with another actor, for the same objective, to \nachieve advantage, without hostile intent, and compete in accordance \nwith the rules -based international order. Rivals are usually found in the \nrivalry zone of the continuum of competit ion. \nAdversary  An actor whose intentions or interests are opposed to those of friendly \nparties and against which legal coercive political, military or civilian actions may be envisaged and conducted. They may have many \ndifferent motivations and may be subject to a broad range of influences \nand are usually found in the confrontation zone of the continuum of \ncompetition.  \nEnemy  An actor whose actions are hostile and against which the legal use of \narmed force is authorized. Enemies operate in the armed conflict zone of \nthe continuum of competition.  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 9 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.13.  Analysing and Categorising Audiences .  The position of individuals and groups \nwithin the range of audiences is not fixed.  In Figure 1.3  attitudes and behaviours are \ndepicted on the horizontal axis, while audience classification is shown on the vertical axis. \nThe interrelated factors of changes in the audience’s will and capability generally determine \nwhether an audience is an actor, stakeholder or public. A range of effects can undermine or \nstrengthen an audience’s will. The capability of an audience can be developed, purchased, \nenabled, as well as being neutralized, denied or destroyed. Generally, changing an \naudience’s capability is quic ker and more readily achievable than changing attitudes, which \nrequires long- term, persistent engagement.   \n1.14.  Narrative- led Execution. Every action creates an informational effect and, via the \ninformation environment, that effect will influence multiple audiences, be they global, national \nor within a theatre of operations. The information that audiences receive is often cluttered, so \nthey use narratives to give meaning to actions and facts. A narrative will often compete with \nother narratives to give the fact its meaning. If the facts are not irrefutable, it is often the credibility of the narrative that is decisiv e in influencing the perception of different audiences. \nTherefore, to effectively influence audiences, it requires consistency of actions, images and words; this consistent message is the narrative and is supported by narrative- led execution.  \nThe Manoeuvrist  Approach (JDP 0 -01) \n1.15.  Overview .  The manoeuvrist approach is one in which shattering the enemy’s overall \ncohesion and will to fight is paramount, rather than just destroying his forces and equipment.  \nIt is an indirect approach which emphasises targeting the enemy’s moral component of his \nfighting power rather than the physical.  Central to the concept is the need to seize, retain and exploit the initiative.  This approach is most effective when it is used in conjunction with \nmission command.  The manoeuvrist approach aims to apply strength against identified \nvulnerabilities , to induce shock, through surprise, shock action, and destruction, leading to \nan enemy’s collapse, which is followed by friendly force exploitation.   \n1.16.  Requirements.  The Manoeuvrist Approach, enabled by Mission Command, has two \nspecific requirements: an attitude of mind and understanding of the enemy’s vulnerabilities.  \nFigure 1 .3 Audiences in the operating environment  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Attitude of Mind.\nThe M\nanoeuvrist\nApproach requires an\nattitude of mind that\nseeks indirect solutions\nto reduce the enemy’swill to fight, by pitchi\nng\nour\n strength against\nenemy vulnerability,\nrather than strength.\n•Understanding .\nThe s\necond \nrequirement is an \nunderstanding of the \nenemy’s vulnerabilities, \nboth before contact \nand as they appear \nand evolve during \nbattle. Centre of gravity \nanalysis can be a useful tool for this. The \nManoeuvrist Approach guides us to find, attack, and exploit these vulnerabilities in an \nenemy’s strength.  \n1.17.  Approach .  The manoeuvrist approach seeks to out -think and outmanoeuvre \ncompetitors and potential adversaries physically, cognitively and virtually across  the \noperational domains\n3. The manoeuvrist approach seeks to seize and hold the initiative, \nshape understanding, and undermine will and fracture cohesion.  \n•Seizing and holding the initiative. Seizing and holding the initiative aims to impose\nmultiple and simultaneous  problems on the enemy .  This advantage is achieved by\ncreating confusion and overwhelming their ability to make decisions and act coherently.\nSeizing the initiative is intrinsically linked to applying the tenet of mission command.\nMaintaining the initiative allows the commander to dictate the course of events andmaintain relentless pressure on the unsupportive audience. Seizing and maintaining th\ne\ni\nnitiative requires the application of several factors. These factors are mutually reinforci ng\nand s\nhould not be applied in isolation.\no Pre-emption . Pre -emption involves seizing an opportunity to deny actor an\nadv\nantage before they act, or preventing a stakeholder from acting. It denies them\nthe initiative and frustrates their plan. Its success lies in understanding, taki ng\nc\nalculated risk, speed of execution and subsequent exploitation.\no Surprise . Surprise is a principle of multinational operations and is one of t he\nm\nost significant contributors to military success at all levels. Surprise involves usi ng\nam\nbiguity, concealment, deception, originality and audacity to confuse and disrupt\ndecision- making. Surprise is a potent cognitive weapon, causing shock thr ough\nunex\npected action in time, location and operational domain.\no Simultaneity. Simultaneity seeks to overload the decision- making of actors\nand stakeholders by confronting them with a concentration of simultaneous threats,which is achieved through the integration and synchronization of actions and effects.\nThis will overload their ability to understand the situation or prioritize responses,\nthereby creating a dilemma that effectively paralyzes their command and control. By\nacting simultaneously, the effect is cumulative; they are threatened by so many\n3 See SOHB Serial 01-01-03 Manoeuvrist Approach (JDP 0-01)\nManoeuvrist\nApproach\nSeizing and \nholding the \ninitiative\nUndermining Will \n& Fracturing \nCohesion\nShapin g\nUnderstandingAttitude \nof MindUnderstandingRequirements\nPre-emption\nSurprise\nSimultaneity\nTempo\nExploitation\nDislocation\nDisruptionA\np\np\nr\no\na\nc\nhMethods\nFigure 1 .4 Manoeuvrist Approach Schematic  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 11 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 concurrent threats that they are denied the ability to concentrate on one problem at a \ntime or even establish priorities between them.  \no Tempo . Tempo is the rate of action relative to another audience. Speed and \nquality of decision- making is key to gaining and maintaining a favourable tempo. \nImportantly, tempo is relative and can be achieved by slowing down the hostile \nactor’s decision- action cy cle through methods like surprise, simultaneity or disruption \nof key capacities.  \no Exploitation . Exploitation is the use of successes or opportunities to \nmaximize advantages or gains. It means seizing opportunities created by activities to achieve an objective, exploiting points of influence, or directly fulfilling part of the \nhigher commander’s int ent. Success must be ruthlessly exploited to maintain the \ninitiative, extend and expand its effects, and accelerate the collapse of the \nunsupportive actor’s will. Opportunities for exploitation may occur only fleetingly and \ncommanders at all levels should anticipate and seize opportunities as they occur, \nwhich makes mission command critical to exploiting the initiative.  \n• Shaping understanding. The manoeuvrist approach seeks to manipulate \nperceptions and understanding to produce favourable attitudes and behavioural \noutcomes in selected audiences. The perception of failure is the best mechanism to \npromote actual failure. Understanding shapes an audience’s attitude by influencing how \nthey think, feel and respond to information or events, and ultimately the actor’s will to continue contesting a situation. Therefore, reducing an audience’s ability to understand \nthe situation ser ves to weaken their moral component.  \n• Undermining will and fracturing cohesion . Will and cohesion are indivisible. Will is \nthe determination to persist in the face of adversity .  It has two aspects: intent and \nresilience. Cohesion is linked to all the components of fighting power. Our  own will and \ncohesion must be protected from the actions of adversaries. Will and cohesion can be \ntargeted through dislocation , disruption and ultimately destruction . \no Dislocation. Dislocation denies an actor the ability to bring strengths to bear \nby not accepting the premise or terms of the engagement. Dislocation is about \nensuring that the unsupportive actor’s strengths are unavailable, focused in the \nwrong place, or rendered ineffective or irrelevant.  \no Disruption. Disruption denies an unsupportive actor’s ability to join together  \ntheir actions by targeting critical capabilities and other points of influence upon which \nthey depend. This is attained by neutralization or destruction, which can be either \nattritional or annihilatory  (destroy)  in nature. Disruption on multiple points of influence \ncan create cognitive paralysis.  \n1.18.  Note:  NATO AJP- 01 combines the two aspects of “shaping understanding” and \n“undermining will and cohesion”  mentioned above into a single aspect called “ Targeting the \nmoral component of Fighting power ” - achieved  by shaping understanding and undermining \nwill and cohesion”.  \nMission Command  \n1.19.  A commander’s primary responsibility is to accomplish the missions and tasks that \ncontribute to specific objectives in line with his  higher commander’s intent and the strategic \nnarrative. This requires the fusion of:  \n• leadership , derived from the leadership culture (that is part of the moral component);  \n• command authority , as allocated formally to a commander through orders and \ndirectives; and  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 12 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •control , the manner in which the commander manages and directs forces  and\nf\nunctions consistent with command authority .\n1.20.  Mission Command Overview .  How a military force blends leadership, command \nauthority and control is fundamental to how it orchestrates fighting power. Mission command \noffers a philosophy of command that advocates centralised planning that includes provision \nof clear guidance and intent with decentralised execution.  This is based on mission-type orders; a style that describes the ‘what’ needs to be achieved, without necessarily \nprescribing the ‘how’.  Mission command is based on empowered leadership, which enables \ndecisions to be made by those best placed to make them, exploiting opportunities that \nemerge. Mission command offers a significant advantage when applied correctly, enabling the joint force to overcome a rival in the most chaotic and demanding circumstances by maximizing initiative to seiz e opportunities . \n1.21.  Mission Command Fundamentals. Successful mission command is guided by the \nfundamentals of trust  and mutual understanding. \n•Trust . Trust is a prerequisite of command at all levels. The level of trust between the\ncommander and a subordinate dictates the level in which the subordinate can and will\n be\nf\nree to decide how to execute their mission and task within the framework of the higher\ncommander’s intent and assigned mission and includes:\nowhere and how to establish their main effort;\nowhat risks to take; and\nohow to synchronize their activities.\nThe spirit of mission command requires a bond of trust between superiors, subordinates and peers that will develop through shared experience. While trust must be earned and \nnot demanded, the default should be for commanders to trust their superiors and \nsubordinates.   \n•M\nutual Understanding . Like trust, mutual understanding is established over tim e\nand t\nhrough applying common training and doctrine. The practice of acting in accordanc e\nw\nith the higher commander’s intent, even when communications are limited, can only be\nsuccessful if there is a high degree of unity in thinking and action at all levels ofoperations. Mutual understanding builds trust. Mutual understanding is also based on\ncommon doctrine and command philosophy and so cannot be assumed when operati\nng\ni\nn a multinational, inter -agency and civilian context.Trust\nMutual \nUnderstandingPeopleMission\nTimely & \nEffective \nDecision \nMakingUnity of \nEffort\nDecentralised \nExecution\nFigure 1 .5 Illustrating the fundamentals and principles of Mission Command  (Adapted AJP -01 Fig 4.2)  \nSERIAL 1-02-01 \n1–02–01 - 13 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.22.  Mission Command Principles . The following principles provide a continuous cycle \nof unity of effort, timely and effective decision- making, and decentralized execution:  \n• Unity of effort . To achieve unity of effort, it is essential to plan, communicate and \ncoordinate at all levels and with all actors involved in a comprehensive approach to crisis. \nAchieving unity of effort is often complicated by the variety of international military and \nnon-military actors involved, the lack of command -and-control  arrangements between \nthem, and varying views of the objectives or end state. Some international organizations \nand non- governmental organizations may refuse to cooperate directly w ith military forces. \nThis will require a flexible approach towards establishing processes or bodies to share \ninformation between the involved international organizations a  \n• Timely and effective decision -making. Successful command requires timely and \neffective decision- making at all levels. Mission command empowers subordinate \ncommanders, who are best placed to make decisions, the authority to do so. Timely \ndecisions allow the Alliance’s forces to gain and maintain the initiative .  Developing an \nintuitive understanding of when to decide is as integral a component of the art of \ncommand as knowing from where to command. The essential elements to any decision-\nmaking process are detailed in Allied Joint Publication (AJP) -3, Allied Joint  Doctrine for \nthe Conduct of Operations.  \n• Decentralized execution. Decentralized execution enables subordinates the \nfreedom of action to act independently, which enables agility in changing situations and \nthe ability to exploit opportunities in accordance with their overall objective. C ommanders \nmust delegate the maximum freedom of action in line with their subordinates’ ability. This \nis affected by a commander's style of command. Where control measures are \nestablished, these have a role in reducing the complementary need for direct comm and \nstyle. If control measures are  ambiguous, weak or absent, more direct command is \ninevitably required. These control measures only specify how a mission will be executed if \nthere are political, legal or military restraints, to enable coordination and synchronization \nof actions on the objective. Decentralized execution depends upon:  \no commanders ensuring that their subordinates understand the intent, their own \ncontributions and the context including the narrative within which they are to act;  \no commanders exercising minimum control over their subordinates, consistent \nwith the context and nature of the mission, and the subordinates’ experience and ability, while retaining responsibility for their actions;  \no subordinates having a sound understanding of the overall plan, what objective \nthey are contributing to, the effect they are to create, and why;  \no subordinates being allocated sufficient resources to carry out their missions, \nand subordinates deciding for themselves how best to act on their superior’s intent, \nincluding where and how to establish their main effort and what risks to take;  \no subordinates communicating their plan to the commander to ensure \nsituational awareness; and \no subordinates having the willingness to accept the trust placed in them, and \nthe initiative to act within any freedom of action given.  \nDoctrinal Frameworks:  \n1.23.  Doctrine produces conceptual frameworks  as tools  to aid commander’s \nunderstanding and help design and plan operations.   They include analytical frameworks \nsuch as PEMSSII -PT covered in Serial 3 -01-06.  In addition,  there are operations , functional, \ngeographic and joint function framewor ks. Selection of the best doctrinal framework to \nemploy will depend on the situation,  the needs of the force and the type of operation.  \n \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 14 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 NATO Operations Framework (AJP 01)  \n1.24.  The operations framework describes tactical operations as : \n•Shaping (tasks create the conditions required to allow the decisive tasks.)\n•Decisive (tasks that are those essential to achieve the objective.)\n•or Supporting  (tasks that enable and support to ensure f reedom  of action.)\nThe operations framework describes their  purpose and links them to the commander’s \nmanoeuvre plan. It sets the operating scheme and desired result. The commander uses the \noperations framework to synchronize their forces’ activities in time and space according to \nthe objective  (purpose) . It enables a clear view of relationships between the effects and \nobjectives. It also enhances the forces’ focus on the end state and avoids mission creep.  \nFunctional Framework (AJP -01) \n1.25.  The Functional Framework is also known as the Tactical Framework in UK Land \nDoctrine .  The Functional Framework takes the 4 core functions of manoeuvre and provides \na framework for a scheme of manoeuvre : \n•Find (The find function concerns discerning the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses\nin the broadest sense, as well as identifying and locating specific capabilities  and\nv\nulnerabilities to target .)\n•Fix (To gain freedom of action, a commander must deny the enemy the opportunity\nto achieve their goals and put them in a reactive frame of mind. )\n•Strike  (The strike function exploits the freedom of action created by fixing.)\n•Exploit  (To exploit is to turn opportunities to advantage. Exploitation may expand the\nscope of an engagement beyond its original objective.)\nGeographic Framework (AJP -01) \n1.26.  Geography is important because it describes where an operation’s tactical actions \nand their effects  occur. The Geographic Framework describes the ‘where and when’ of \nemploying actions. In this framework, deep and rear operations are defined by the close operational engagement space around the joint force. The geographic framework is: \n•Deep ( The purpose of deep operations is to fracture the cohesion of an opponent\nand establish an advantage before conducting close operations . Examples are\nInformation Activities , ISTAR, Fires, Deep manoeuvre and they will invariably require\nclose coordination with all  components of a joint force. )\n•Close (Close operations occur at short range, their effects are immediate a\nnd\nt\nangible.  Close operations occur once the conditions for success have been set by\ndeep operations. )\n•Rear (Rear operations ensure freedom of action by protecting and sustaining a force.\nThey also maintain freedom of action for uncommitted forces. Although rear\noperations include administration, logistics and protection, their effect is much wider;\nwithin the overall scheme of manoeuvre, they create the conditions for successfuldeep and close operations. )\nEven in a non -linear engagement space, the concepts of deep, close and rear, and a sense \nof range and proximity, aid understanding. When used in combination with other \nframeworks, they provide a powerful method to help visualize, organize and integrate act ivity \nacross the operational domains, and the electromagnetic and acoustic spectra.  \nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 15 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Joint Function Framework (AJP -01) \n1.27.  The joint function framework assists commanders to integrate political, military \nand civilian actions through the operational domains. The joint functions describe and \ncategorise the required detailed capabilities of the force.  They  are explained in the table \nbelow.  In any operation these joint functions are to be considered, although each \nindividual functions’ amount of contribution, its significance and its demand will vary. The \nJoint Function Framework is also known as the Tactical Functions  in UK Land Doctrine.  \n1.28.  The joint function framework uses a combination of manoeuvre, fires, information \nand CIMIC to affect the audience’s attitude and behaviour. It is 'informed and directed' \nby the joint functions of command and control and intelligence, and 'supported' by the joint functions of sustainment and force protection, as shown in Figure 1.5 below .\n \nNATO Joint Functions (AJP -3 Para 1.41 – 1.60) (Summary)  \nJoint functions provide a sound framework of related capabilities and activities grouped \ntogether to assist commanders to integrate, synchronize, and direct various capabilities \nand activities in joint operations.  \n1. Command and control . C2 encompasses the exercise of authority and direction by\na commander over assigned and attached forces to accomplish the mission.\n2. Intelligence. The role of intelligence is to contribute to a continuous and coordinat ed\nunder\nstanding of the operating environment, to support commanders by identifyi ng\nc\nonditions required to achieve objectives; avoiding undesired effects; and assessing the\nimpact of adversary, friendly and neutral actors on the commanders’ concept of\noperations. Intelligence is therefore an aid to provide situational awareness, developunderstanding and is a critical tool for decision- making\n3. Manoeuvre . The principal purpose of manoeuvre is to gain positional advantage i n\nr\nespect to the adversary from which force can be threatened or applied. Manoeuvre seeks\nto render adversary’s  incapable of resisting effectively throughout all dimensions of the\nJOA effectively by shattering their cohesion rather than destroying each of his\ncomponents through incremental attrition.\n4. Fires.  Fires creates effects on a target. They may be applied directly or indirectly t o\nc\nreate a wide range of physical and psychological effects by degrading capability  and\ns\nhattering cohesion. Fires are often delivered by joint assets and may include naval f ire,\nland direct fire, land indirect fire and aerial fire.\n5. Civil -military cooperation. CIMIC is a joint function comprising a set of capabilities\nintegral to supporting the achievement objectives and enabling NATO commands t o\npar\nticipate effectively in a broad spectrum of C ivil-M ilitary Interaction (CMI)  with diverse\nnon-military actors.\n6. Information. The use of information is critical to decision making processes. Actors’\nperception within the operating environment is dependent on information available t o\nt\nhem. Agility and proactive action in the information environment is critical to operational\nsuccess.\n7. Sustainment . Forces and their fighting power need to be sustained through all\nphases of operations. Sustainment provides for the comprehensive provision of personnel;\nlogistics; medical; and general MILENG support required to maintain combat power\nthroughout all phases of the operation.\nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 16 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 8. Force protection. Force protection is a function aimed at minimizing the\nvulnerability of personnel, facilities, equipment, materiel, operations and activities from\nthreats and hazards to preserve freedom of action and operational effectiveness thereby\ncontributing to mission success. The fundamental elements of force protection are\nsecurity, military engineering support to force protection, air defence, medical forc e\npr\notection and force health protection, consequence management, r esilience, tactical ar ea\nof\n responsibility control, and CBRN defence.\nJoint Action  Framework  (AJP-3) \n1.29.  Joint Action Overview .  While tactical commanders possess the means to conduct \nmilitary activities at their level, their capabilities are most effective when integrated and \nsynchronized across the joint force. The conceptual framework that permits force integration \nand synchronization is called joint action.  Joint Action is neither a new capability nor an \nactivity in its own right.  Instead, it is a framework for considering the integration, \ncoordination and synchronisation of all military activity within the battlespace.  It is described \nas: “the deliberate use and orchestration of military capabilities and activities to affect an \nactor’s understanding, capability and will, and the cohesion between them. ” \n•Understanding . An adversary’s understanding underpins their decision- making;\nhowever, it is not absolute and does not endure. Their understanding of the situation\n–the competing narratives, relative strengths, effectiveness and vulnerabilities –\naffects perception and, therefore, their will to act.\n•Capability. Capability depends on a physical capacity for action and applying it\neffectively and in context. While there is often an advantage conferred by quantity\nand quality, other factors, such as prioritizing resources are at the commander’s\ndiscretion and therefore subject to influence.\n•Will. The will to act or resist at the operational and tactical level is based on the unityof communities of interest or armed groups, fighting spirit, morale and cohesion. Willcan be affected physically (through activities like fires) and psychologically (t hroughFigure 1 .6 Illustrating the Joint Function Framework  Fires Manoeuvre\nCivil -military \ncooperation \n(Outreach )InformationInfluence \nattitude & \nbehaviourCommand & Control Intelligence\nSustainment Force ProtectionActionsInformed &\ndirected by\nSupported by\nSERIAL 1-02- 01 \n1–02– 01 - 17 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 perception or surprise). Once the will to act is lost, an adversary relinquishes the \nability to affect events.  \n•Cohesion. Cohesion is fundamental to any group’s ability to fight and resisteffectively. It combines understanding, capability and will to generate the strength t\no\nac\nt in unison through motivation, allegiance and resolve.\n1.30.  Joint Action Implementation.   Joint Action is implemented through the \ncoordination of  four of the Joint Functions : \n•Information:  To manipulate information, or perceptions of information, to primarilyaffect understanding.\n•Fires:  The deliberate use of physical, or virtual, means to achieve, primarily,physical effects.\n•CIMIC :  Enables engagement and coordination to  create, build and maintai\nn\nr\nelationships between relevant non -military and  military actors.\n•Manoeuvre :  Used to gain advantage in time and space.\nFigure 1.7 Illustration of how Joint Action may be used to coordinate tactical activities . \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 MARITIME DOCTRINE FUNDAMENTALS  \nGENERAL  \n2.1. This summary is taken from JDP 0-1 0 UK Maritime Power 5th Edition Oct 2017 (paras in \nbrackets) and is coherent with the MAJCSC Maritime Reader Edition 5 (2025). \n2.\n2. Maritime Power .  This is defined as: “ the ability to apply maritime military capabilities \nat and from the sea to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events. ” (Para 1.3)  \n2.3. The Maritime Environment .  This comprises; “ the high seas, exclusive economic \nzones and territorial seas … multidimensional as maritime forces operate above on and \nbelow the surface of the sea”.  (Para 1.6)  \n2.4. The Littoral Region.  This is defined as: “ those land areas (and their adjacent areas \nand associated air space) that are susceptible to engagement and influence from the sea.  Conversely, it also includes those areas of the sea susceptible to engagement from the land, \nfrom both land and air forces ”.  (Para 1.6).  \n2.5. Fundamental UK Maritime Power Roles.  The three fundamental UK maritime \npower roles are: (Para 1.7)  \nWar Fighting  Maritime Security  Defence \nEngagement  \nTHE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT  \n2.6. Dimensions of the Maritime Environment .  There are five dimensions of the \nmaritime environment.  \n•Economic.  The maritime environment acts as the principal means of movement forover 80% of the world’s trade by volume and 70% by value.  Fossil fuels, minerals\nand fish are important resources in the maritime environment. Submarine cables\ncarry 99% of the globe’s internet traffic.   Access to the ocean is therefore of\nparamount concern to all the world’s major economies.  (from Para 2.4)\n•Physical .  The sea covers over 70% of the globe’s surface ranging from th\ne deep\nw\naters of the open oceans to the shallower littoral regions adjacent to the land.\nAlong with space and cyberspace, the oceans outside of state authority make up t he\ngl\nobal commons and  no state may legitimately subject any part of the high seas to its\nsovereignty.  Global choke points  (eg Straits of Hormuz, Bab al -Mandab) funnel\ninternational shipping and restrict freedom of navigation.   (from Para 2.8)\n•Political .  The extension of coastal state jurisdiction may increase the likelihood of\ndisputes both between bordering states and also between coastal states and fl ag\ns\ntates exercising freedom of navigation; maritime power plays a vital role in resisti ng\nf\nurther restrictions on high seas freedoms.  States use the freedom provided by t he\noc\neans as a conduit for building relationships, strengthening ties and providi ng\nas\nsistance and reassurance to li ke-minded states.   (from Para 2.14)\n•Legal .  The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is  a\nbr\noad-ranging legal framework which defines many of the rights and responsibilities\nof states in the use of the world’s oceans.  UNCLOS divide s the sea into a number of\nzones measured from the baseline, normally the low water line along a nation’scoast, which set s geographical limits in which state authority diminishes.  The picture\nbelow highlights the principal zones and the table summarises the entitlements of\nindividual stat es in these maritime zones : (from Para 2.10)\nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 UNCLOS Sea Zones and Descriptions : \nZone /Area  Description  \nBaseline  Except where otherwise provided in the United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea (UNCLOS), the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the \nterritorial sea is the low -water line along the coast as marked on large- scale \ncharts officially recognised by the coastal state.  \nInternal Waters  Covers all of the waters on the landward side of the baseline. The state is \nresponsible for setting laws and governing their use.  \nTerritorial \nSeas/waters  From the baseline to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles. The state is \nresponsible for setting laws and governing their use, subject to the right of \nvessels from other states exercising the right of innocent, or in international \nstraits, transit passage.  \nContiguous Zone  A zone that may not exceed 24 nautical miles  from the base line,  in which a \nstate can intervene to prevent potential offences which may otherwise occur \ninside territorial waters, or to apprehend a vessel that has committed an offence \ninside territorial waters and is attempting to escape.  \nExclusive \nEconomic Zone \n(EEZ)  This area extends up to 200 nautical miles from the baseline. Within this area a \nstate has sole claim over all natural resources. This includes exploiting \nresources such as oil, gas and fishing. Other states enjoy high seas freedoms in \nthe EEZ, provided these activities do not impact on the coastal state’s rights and \njurisdictions in the EEZ as set out in UNCLOS.  \nContinental Shelf  The continental shelf of a coastal state comprises the seabed and subsoil of the \nsubmarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to \na distance of 200 nautical miles from the baseline.  \nHigh Seas  The high seas are open to all states who may enjoy the freedom of the high seas \nsubject only to the conditions described in UNCLOS/customary law.  Vessels on \nthe high seas are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their flag states, with a \nfew very important exceptions: for example, piracy is a crime of  universal \njurisdiction.  \nFigure 2.1 Illustrating the UNCLOS Sea Zones  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 •Military .  States or other actors may seek to exploit the sea to exert influence upon\nt\nhose they wish to persuade, deter and, if necessary, compel. Equally, maritim e\nf\norces can offer reassurance to allies through a military presence which may also be\na useful lever to help prevent conflict.  Maritime forces can also provide support to\nhumanitarian and disaster relief operations, which has the added benefit of buildi ng\ngl\nobal political relationships and influence.  (from  Para 2.16 ).\nTHE ATTRIBUTES OF MARITIME FORCES  \n2.7. Every military force has distinctive attributes brought about by the characteristics of \nthe environment in which it operates.  Maritime forces have five of these attributes, shown \nbelow.  The purpose of  the attributes  is to generate influence.  Influence is defined as: the \ncapacity to have an effect on the character or behaviour of someone or something, or the \neffect itself. The ability to influence is intrinsically related to the ability to project military \npower.  (from Para 3.15)  \n2.8. Access.  The long-\nstanding principle of freedom of \nnavigation in international waters allows maritime forces to access areas of national interest and potential threat. This access guarantees freedom of navigation for maritime forces up to 12 nautical miles from a \ncoastline to allow options for intervention at a time and place of national choosing.  (Para 3.18)  \n2.9. Poise .  Poise is the ability of \nmaritime forces to loiter in international waters demonstrating a forward military presence at readiness without the political and military complications and risks of deploying forces ashore or projecting from a third- party location. (Para 3.19)  \n2.10.  Mobility .  Exploiting the access and freedom of navigation afforded by the \nsea, provides maritime forces with a high degree of mobility. These rights facilitate maritime manoeuvre and provide a deployable force that can reposition quickly or cover significant dist ances to respond to situations. While shipping lacks the speed \nof aircraft, unless maritime- based aircraft are available to respond, maritime \nplatforms are continuously mobile while having the ability to carry significantly more payload.  This provides huge flexibility at both the tactical and operational levels. (Para 3.20)  \n2.11.  Persistence .  Maritime forces are able to offer a unique persistence providing \na sovereign capability that can be established with minimal political and logistic commitment and easily withdrawn. The endurance provided by on- board stocks, the \nability to replenish at sea and operate at range from host -nation support provides a \nsustained presence unlike that provided by any other military force. However, persistence is tempered by the nature of the environment, the range of engineering spares held on- board and the inability to replenish some weapon systems while at \nsea. (Para 3.21)  \n2.12.  Versatility .  Maritime forces are uniquely versatile, easily changing their \nmilitary posture, while undertaking several tasks concurrently and remaining Influence AcccessPoiseMobility\nPersistance\nVersatillity\nFigure 2.2 The Attributes of Maritime Forces  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 available for rapid re- tasking. Deploying with inherently high levels of readiness, a \nwarship can transition from a peacetime state to a combat ready one in a matter of \nhours.  \nPRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF MARITIME POWER  \n2.13.  The strategic use of maritime power is made possible through the concept of sea \ncontrol and underpinned by the principles of maritime manoeuvre and maritime power \nprojection. These are supported by a number of operational approaches. (Para 3.25)  \n2.14.  Sea Control .  The concept of ‘ sea control’ , is where a maritime force establishes the \nconditions to allow freedom of action in a particular part of the sea, at a particular time, to the required degree and, if necessary, deny its use to an opponent.  Sea control requires control \nof the surface and  subsurface environments (including the seabed), the air above the area in \nwhich sea control is required, the electromagnetic environment and potentially areas of the land where that part of the land dominates the sea. (Para 3.26)  \n2.15.  Levels of Sea Control .  The level of sea control required, and indeed achievable, \nwill depend upon the threat and the mission. Where sea control is not contested the force has achieved it by default and can focus on delivering maritime manoeuvre or maritime \npower projection. I f there is any risk to freedom of action, sea control is necessary; however, \nif the risk is small, the capabilities required can be correspondingly modest. Gaining the necessary level of sea control early, and retaining it, will be a major component of any maritime or expeditionary operation.  (Para 3.27)  \n2.16.  Sea Control Operational Approaches .  Where sea control is necessary it can be \nachieved through one of a number of operational approaches. (from Para 3.28)  \na. Decisive Battle.  While a successful decisive battle at sea, where maritim e\nf\norces classically oppose each other is exceedingly rare in the modern era, a decisiv e\nengagem\nent is not.  A singular act can provide sea control.\nb. Sea Denial .  Sea denial is a form of anti -access and area denial exercised w hen\none par\nty prevents an adversary from controlling a maritime area without being able to\ncontrol that area oneself. It can be a tool for a superior maritime force, either in a\nsecondary area of operations, or for one phase of a larger campaign. Classic means of\nachieving sea denial include laying a minefield or deploying submarines to threat en\nenem\ny surface forces. A more recent method, particularly appropriate in littoral\noperati ons, is to project land assets such as surface- to-surface missile batteries al ong\nt\nhe coast to pose an unacceptable level of risk to maritime units.\nc. Fleet -in-being .  A state deprived of maritime superiority might choose, or  be\nf\norced, to adopt a strategy of fleet -in-being.  By avoiding confrontation with  a superior\nenemy a state can hold back its own maritime forces but continue to threaten those of\nthe enemy or their ability to carry out their mission.\nd. Blockade.  This allows the presence of a stronger maritime power to contai n an\nadv\nersary reluctant to fight, or force a decisive battle on them.\n2.17.  Maritime Manoeuvre.  Sea control and the legal framework which allows \nunrestricted access and presence no closer than 12 nautical miles from the baseline in \npeacetime is a key enabler for maritime manoeuvre.  The ability to operate, particularly in \nlittoral areas, is of cru cial importance, either as the main effort or as the staging area for \ndeploying and sustaining ground forces.  Therefore, as well as the central requirement to be \ncapable of controlling events at sea, maritime power must also be capable of influencing \nevents on land from the sea. (from Para 3.30)  \n2.18.  Maritime Power Projection.  Maritime power projection is the threat, or use, of \nnational power from the sea to influence events. It exploits sea control and maritime \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 manoeuvre to achieve access to threaten or project force ashore using a combination of \namphibious forces, embarked aircraft, land attack weapons, cyber capabilities, electronic \nwarfare and Special Forces.  There are numerous ways in which maritime power pr ojection \ncan contribute to a joint operation.  (from Para 3.33)  \na. Shape.   The sea is, in most cases, a highway free from boundaries and frontiers \nthat provides a valuable arena for joint force manoeuvre.  In preparation for \nsubsequent operations, maritime forces can, for example, be employed to gather \nintelligence and / or mou nt non -combatant evacuation operations.  They may also be \nused to insert special operations forces or to conduct amphibious operations.  \nb. Reassure.   The presence of maritime forces can be used to reassure a friendly \nstate.  A state reassured by the presence of maritime forces is more likely to provide \naccess, basing and overflight.  \nc. Deter .  Maritime forces can be used to deter an aggressor by deploying into a \nregion at an early stage, at relatively low political risk and, if necessary, in considerable strength.  \nd. Coerce.   As maritime forces build up in theatre, they can launch discrete \namounts of mixed land, air, or maritime power against key targets to force an \nadversary away from one course of action or to compel them to take another.  \ne. Disrupt .  Prior to the main offensive, maritime forces can help to shift the \nemphasis from defensive to offensive operations by disrupting enemy activity through \nthe use of amphibious raids  \nf. Project .  An important role of maritime forces, particularly amphibious forces, is \nto provide manoeuvre from the sea.  Speed of manoeuvre at sea will often surprise opponents ashore.  \ng. Support .  The maritime component’s capabilities, in particular its ability to \nengage in precision attack, can support friendly forces ashore or in the air.  Additionally, the sea base may be used to hold a reserve force or serve as a command \nplatform.  \nh. Limit .  Maritime forces can guard the maritime flanks of an operating area and \nby doing so, limit the freedom of manoeuvre of an enemy.  \ni. Recover .  When it comes to withdrawal, maritime forces have the capability to \ntransport large numbers of personnel and equipment out of theatre whilst protecting \nthem in the process.  They may also remain in theatre to provide a strategic reserve.  \nROLES OF MARITIME FORCES \n2.19.  Traditionally  maritime forces have been used by states for a wide variety of tasks. \nThe accepted consensus is that there is a ‘trinity’ of ‘three characteristic modes of action by \nwhich maritime forces operate: namely military, diplomatic and policing functions’.  Thes e \nfunctions have evolved to:  \n• War Fighting.  \n• Maritime S ecuri ty. \n• Defence Engagement . \nIn practice, most operations undertaken by maritime forces will incorporate aspects of each \nof these three roles. They are interrelated and may be conducted concurrently or \nconsecutively with little or no physical change to the force structure. (From Para 4.1)  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024 2.20.  Role 1 – War Fighting.  A credible hard power capability provides the foundations \non which the softer roles of maritime security and Defence Engagement are built. Therefore, \nat its core maritime forces must be able to deter potential aggressive acts against the \nsovereign state, and where this fails, conduct successful combat operations in pursuit of the \nnational interest.  In this role maritime forces will generally be configured into a maritime task \ngroup, able to project maritime power through either carrier strike or  littoral manoeuvre, \nwhich provides the capability of projecting a landing force ashore. (Para 4.4)  \n2.21.  Role 2 – Maritime Security .  Maritime security operations  (MSO)  are conducted \nagainst a wide range of activities.  Principally the focus is on the support to trade, including \nfisheries, to safeguard national prosperity.  These are known as Maritime Trade Operations. \nOther activities include: (Para 4.5)  \n•Defence (short of war fighting)  which includes Peace Support Operations (PSO)  and\nt\nhe various forms of Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA) .\n•Humanitarian assistance  and\ndi\nsaster relief  (HADR) .\n•No\nn-combatant evacuati on\noper\nations  (NEO) .\n•Countering piracy, slavery,\npeople smuggling, illegalimmigration, drug smuggling,\narms smuggling, terrorism and\nthe proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction.\n•Freedom of n avigati\non\noper\nations where maritim e\nf\norces exert their rights under\ninternational law to pass\nthrough or exercise i n\nc\nontested waters .\n•Military data gathering may also be \nconsidered a form of MSO as it enables \nmaritime trade operations as well as warfighting. \n2.22.  Role 3 – Defence Engagement .  The versatility and mobility of maritime forces \nprovides a means for political and diplomatic influence in international relations.  Ships’ visits to foreign ports are an important way of projecting soft power globally.   At the MAJCSC , \nstudents are taught that Defence Engagement may be considered in 3 areas:  \n•Conflict prevention to which maritime forces contribute in 2 ways: through deterrence\n,\nbot\nh conventional and nuclear,  and through exercising presence.\n•Post-conflict reconstruction which includes security sector reform (SSR) and capacity\nbuilding.\n•Defence diplomacy which  includes\n–Ship visits  to promote:\nHigh level international engagement (HLIE) and other senior officer visits,\nthe provision of training and education (ie capacity building) and t he\ndepl\noyment of defence attachés.War \nFighting\nDefence \nEngagement\nThe \nuse of \nthe Sea\nMaritime \nSecurity\nFigure 3.3 Roles of Maritime Forces  \nSERIAL 1-02-02 \n1–02–02 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – April 2024  Defence and security exports , for example Defence Security and Investment \nDays (DSID) on board ships, and advising and training foreign personnel in \nthe use of this equipment.  \n– PASSEX (PASSage EXercises) which include most forms of activity conducted at sea between warships and auxiliaries of 2 or more nations.  \nTHE MARITIME CONTRIBUTION TO MILITARY POWER  \n2.23.

Within the land environment , people inhabit towns, cities and\nv\nillages, whilst even apparently unpopulated space often contains resources that\nsupport humans in some way. Control over land is consequently of fundamentalpolitical, cultural and psychological importance, and has often  been regarded as\ndecisive in conflict.\n•Information aspects.  The Land environment  is shaped by the way that populations\ninteract; it is the exchange of information between individuals, tribes, ethnic\n and\ni\nnterest groups, and countries that lie at the heart of human dynamics.  This\ncommunication can be verbal, written or visual and it can be conducted directly\nbetween people or through radio, television or online.  Human interaction is expandi ng\nand ac\ncelerating as information flows in the virtual domain increase, linking individuals,\ngroups and societies globally, unconfined by traditional state boundaries.\nUnlike the air or maritime environments , Land  is distinguished by the fact that it is where \npeople predominantly live. It is in the land environment that the roots of conflict are usually \nfound, since conflict on land involves those things that people tend to value most: their lives, \nvalues, property and resources.  \n3.4. The Attribute of Land Forces.   All land forces, regular or irregular, have four inherent \nattributes.  Each attribute has advantages that can be used, but also disadvantages that have to be avoided or mitigated.  (JDP 0 -20 Para1.7 and Ch 3) . \n•Soldiers – Land forces rely on human initiative, enterprise & intelligence.\n•Presence – Land  is where people predominantly live & the roots of conflict are found\n•Persistence –capacity to endur e in an area for long periods of time .\n•Adaptability  – the ability to conduct a wide range of military and non -military tasks.\nLand power is critically dependent on the other operational domains for support. This \ndependency limits the speed and scale of deployment and the degree to which land forces are \nstrategically mobile. This can be offset somewhat by persistent presence and adaptability, but this approach is costly.  \n3.5. The Purpose of Land Forces. (ADP Land Ops 2 from Para 3- 01) “The core purpose \nof land forces is the defeat of opposing land forces in armed conflict ”. \n3.6. The Critical Capability of Land Forces.   (ADP Land Ops 1 from Para 3- 13) “The \ncritical capability of land forces is the ability  to plan and execute combined arms manoeuvre. \nForce and land forces achieve political objectives. The application and threat of force, and the \ngaining and retention of physical objectives, affect political decision- making in ways  \nconsistent with those objectives.  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 3.7. The Three Fundamental Ideas of Land Forces Doctrine  (Core Tenets)  (ADP Land \nOps 2 from Para 2- 01):  Together , the following three concepts  form the fundamental ideas of \nUK land forces’ doctrine: \n•The Manoeuvris t Approach.\n•Mission Command .\n•The Combined Arms Approach.\n3.8. Manoeuvrist Approach – This is covered in Serial 01-02- 01 Joint Doctrine.  \n3.9. Mission Command  - This is covered in Serial 01-02-01 Joint Doctrine.  \n3.10.  Combined Arms Approach.   The combined arms approach is how land forces \norchestrate effects in land tactical operations by combining forces and capabilities, both lethal \nand non- lethal, to overmatch an opponent. It is defined as:  \n“The synchronised and simultaneous application of forces and capabilities across domains to \nachieve an effect greater than if each element was used separately or sequentially ”.  \nThrough task organisation, it reinforces strengths  and compensates for weakness through \ncomplementary grouping. It also imposes  dilemmas on opponents by confronting them with \nmultiple threats; forces are task  organised so that if the opponent attempts to protect against \none threat, they become  vulnerable in another.   It includes the forces and capabilities of all \narmy, joint, and multinational elements across the tactical functions.  \n3.11.  The Tactical Functions.  (Land adapted from the Joint Function Framework ) (ADP \nLand Ops 2 Para 4-07) The tactical functions represent the full breadth of a land force’s \nactivities when conducting operations. They are: \n•Command\n•Intelligence\n•Manoeuvre\n•Fires\n•Information Activities\n•Capacity Building\n•Protection\n•Sustainment \nThe t\nactical functions are a device that helps to organise activities into intelligible groups; they \nhave no effects, whereas the activities do. Few, if any stand alone. All activity needs to be \ncommanded and sustained for example.  The tactical functions also provide a useful checklist \nfor commanders when assessing a plan, and a common vocabulary for describing a force’s \noverall capabilities.  \n3.12.  Land Doctrinal Frameworks.  Frameworks are a tool that allows a commander and \ntheir staff to visualise, organise, integrate, and describe tactical activities in relation to each other in terms of purpose, time, space, and resources.  Land frameworks , but with some small \nchanges,  follow the broad approach of Joint  doctrinal Frameworks  explained in Serial 1 -02-01. \n•Command\n•Intelligence\nActivity to set & \nmaintain the \noperation's \ndirection\n•Manoeuvre\n•Fires\n•Information Activities\n•Capacity Building\nActivity directed at \nthose relevant to \nthe outcome of the \noperation \n(the audience)  \n•Protection\n•Sustainment\nActivity to enable \nthe operation\nFigure 3.1 The Tactical Functions  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Geographic Framework : (ADP Land Ops 2 Para 4-02).\n• Deep.\n• Close.\n• Rear.\n•Operational Framework (ADP Land Ops 2 Para 4-04) (Land adapted from t he\nO\nperations Framework  – ‘supporting’ becomes ‘sustaining’).\n• Shaping – to create or preserve conditions for decisive action.\n• Decisive – to the achievement of the mission.\n• Sustaining – to enable the force to survive, move and fight.\n•Tactical Framework (ADP Land Ops 2 Para 4-05) (Land adapted from the Functional\nFramework  – name difference only ).\n• Find.\n• Fix.\n• Strike .\n• E\nxploit.\n3.13.  Types of Operation.  Each land tactical operation (See Serial 1 -01-03 for  Campaign \nThemes &  Types of Operation) will consist of a tailored combination of offensive, defensive, \nenabling and stability tactical activities, each of which should be viewed as the building blocks \nof any land tactical operation. The exact combination will be determined by the mission and \nthe commander’s intent. Each tactical activity has a specific aim.  Operations will typically \ncomprise a sequence of tactical activities, for example:  \n•Combat  operations : Reconnaissance, march, obstacle crossing, attack, pursuit or\ntransition to defence.\n\nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024  \n3.14.  Tactical Activities.  (AFM Conventional Warfare from Para 1- 12). Tactical activities \nare grouped by common purpose in four categories : Each type of tactical activit y has \nparticular characteristics and principles. Activities are tangible undertakings that can be \nassigned to units and sub- units, usually through specific tactical tasks such as block, \nseize, etc (see Serial  3-04-03). The table below should not be considered all -inclusive, for \nunique activities and tasks may exist or be developed that are not indicated but that will still fit within one of these four categories. Note also that a large tactical action may include \ndifferent activities. For example, an attack may be enabled by the deployment of a screen \n(security). The key here is for commanders to understand that they are responsible for this \nwhole range of tactical activit y at any given time.  Categories of Tactical Activity.  \n•Offensive activities .\n•Defensive activities .\n•Enabling activities .\n•Stability activities .\nOffensive  Defensive  Stabili ty Enabling  \nAttack : Defence : Security & Control .

The aim of offensive operations is to defeat the enemy and/or \nseize key terrain objectives .  Offensive  tactical activities are described as activities, in which \nforces seek out the enemy to attack the enemy and degrade, destroy, neutralise or otherwise Figure 3.2 Illustrative example of balance of tactical activity plotted against  campaign themes and use of force.  \nFigure 3.3 Tactical Activities ( AFM Conventional & Unconventional Warfare) . \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 affect its capabilities. In addition, they may also focus on seizing or securing terrain objectives \nsuch as vital ground.    \n•Attack.  There are four types of attacks: hasty, deliberate, counter -attack and spoiling.\n•Exploitation .  Is defined as taking full advantage of success in battle and followi ng up\nin\nitial gains.\n•Pursuit .  Pursuit is specifically designed to cut off an enemy force attempting to\nescape, with the aim of defeating it.\n•Raid .  This is defined as an operation, usually small- scale, involving a swift penetrati on\nof\n hostile territory to secure information, confuse the enemy, or destroy their\ninstallations.\n•Ambush .  Is defined as a surprise attack by fire from concealed positions on a movi ng\nor\n temporarily halted enemy .\n•Breakout .  In a breakout activity, an encircled force attempts to link up with other\nfriendly forces .\n3.16.  Defensive Activities.  The aim of d efensive activities is  to: hold vital ground or key \nterrain,  halt an enemy advance, to buy time, or to generate opportunities for offensive action. \nBy holding key terrain or fixing the enemy in one area, the conditions for successful offensive action can be created. The object is to force the enemy into action that narrows their options, \nreduces fighting power and makes them vulnerable to a counter -attack. The challenge is to \nseize the initiative from the attacker. The defender should lure the attacker into situations where they are vulnerable, can be surprised, and fix for defeat by counterattack.   \n•Mobile Defence.  Mobile defence is used to defeat an attack by focusing on theadversary’s forces, rather than seeking to hold ground.\n•Area defence .  Area defence is used to defeat an attack by denial of ground thr\nough\nt\nhe concentration of forces and counter -mobility effects, for example, using obstacles\nor field defences.  A rule of thumb is that a well -prepared defence can defeat or block\nan enemy with a 3:1 advantage.\n•Delay. Delaying activities are those in which a force being pressed by an attackingadversary trades space for time, reducing the adversary’s momentum and inflicti\nng\ndam\nage without itself becoming decisively committed .\n3.17.  Stability Activities .  Stability activities are bespoke tactical methods used for \ndelivering the stabilisation aspect of any land operation. They require a full spectrum  \ncomprehensive approach with host nation and allied agencies.   \n3.18.  Enabling Activities.  Enabling activities link other tactical activities together. They \ninclude those intended to make or break contact with an enemy, and those conducted out of \ncontact. An enabling activity links two tactical activities and is never conducted for its own \nsake.   Successful execution requires the same level of planning and training as that required \nfor offensive, defensive or stability activities. Enabling activities are:  \n•Reconnaissance.   To obtain information about, and understanding of, the human,\ninformation and physical aspects of the land operating environment.  Reconnaissanc e\nc\nan be done by stealth  or using reconnaissance in  force .\n•Security .  To provide early and accurate warning of enemy dispositions and actions to\nprotect and enable the force.\n•The March .  To move a force efficiently to its place of tactical employment.\n•Advance to contact .  To gain or regain contact with an enemy under the most\nfavourable conditions. It is normally executed in preparation for subsequent offensiv e\na\nctivity.\n•Meeting Engagement .  To gain (or regain) the initiative through combat action that\noccurs when a moving force, engages an enemy at an unexpected time and place.\n•Demonstration & Feint .\nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Crossing & breaching of Obstacles.  To project combat power across an obstacle\nwhile ensuring the maintenance of momentum and initiative.\n•Link- up.  To join two or more forces in contested territory\n•Relief of troops.   These are  so that one force can take over the actions or activities\nfrom another. There are several  types :\noRelief in P lace (RIP) .  Occurs when all or part of a force is replaced in  an\noper\nating area by an incoming unit, e.g.,  when rotating forces in area defence.\noForward passage of lines (FPOL) .  Occurs when one force moves forwar d\nt\nhrough another towards the enemy.\noRearward passage of lines (RPOL) .  Occurs when a force moving, usually\nfrom contact, passes through another unit in defence.\n•Withdrawal . (Disengage the force from physical contact with an enemy)\n•Retirement . (Movement  away from and out of contact with an enemy)\n3.19.  Forms of Manoeuvre  (In Attack) .  (AFM Conventional Warfare from Para 2-09) To \nmanoeuvre is to gain a position of advantage relative to the enemy.  During the planning \nprocess, a commander will determine what form of manoeuvre to use in order to position forces where they can achieve an advantage. The attack may be directed against the front, \nflank or rear of the enemy and may be conducted from the ground, air, sea or a combination of \nthese.   There are five basic forms of manoeuvre . \n•Turning movement . A turning movement is a variation of the envelopment in whic\nh\nt\nhe attacking force passes around or over the enemy’s principal defensive positions to\nsecure objectives deep in the enemy’s rear, force the enemy to abandon their positi on\nor\n divert major forces to meet the threat.\n•Envelopment . An envelopment is NATO defined as an offensive manoeuvre where\nthe main attacking force passes around or over the enemy’s principal defensiv e\npos\nitions to secure objectives to the enemy’s rear. It is designed to apply force against\nan enemy vulnerability , but will normally require a diversionary or fixing attack to\ndistract the enemy.\nFigure 3.4 Turning Movement  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Double envelopment .  A double envelopment is an envelopment operation mount ed\non\n two axes that is designed to outflank an enemy from both sides with a view t o\nf\norcing them to abandon their positions, or as a prelude to encirclement and defeat of\nthe trapped forces. It may be also complemented by a diversionary or fixing attack\nagainst  one of their positions.\n•Frontal attack. A frontal attack is an offensive manoeuvre in which the main action is\ndirected against the front of the enemy forces. It will be commonly employed to fix theenemy in position, usually as a precursor for a turning movement or envelopment. A\nfrontal attack could generate surprise and success if another pattern of activity (such\nas attacking the flanks) has been previously established. Usually however, the frontalattack is the least desirable form of manoeuvre as it is typically the approach that t\nhe\nenem\ny is expecting. It should only be considered:\noAgainst a weak or disorganised enemy.\nFigure 3.5 Envelopment  \nFigure 3.6 Double Envelopment  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 oWhen the attacker has overwhelming combat power.\noWhen the time and situation require immediate action.\noWhen the mission is to fix the enemy in position or deceive the enemy\n•Penetration. A penetration is NATO defined as a form of offensive action that seeks  to\nbr\neak through the enemy’s defence and disrupt the defensive system. Infiltration is\npenetration by stealth. Penetration seeks to reach the depths of an enemy’s position\non one or a number of narrow axes. Penetration may be necessary to achieve any of\nthe other forms of manoeuvre. There are three types of penetration (deep, multiple\npenetrations, or a combination of both) and all may be combined in the sam e\noper\nation.\n3.20. Reserves and echelon forces.  A land force commander  must have \nuncommitted forces at his dis posal to maintain flexibility in order to: \n•Maintain momentum and the initiative.\nFigure 3.7 Frontal Attack  \nFigure 3.8 Penetration  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 •Exploit opportunities .\n•React on enemy’s course of action.\n3.21. Echelon forces are those with a pre-p lanned specific mission, but are yet to be \ncommitted, often kept in depth. They are committed onto their planned tasks to sustain the \nmomentum of an oper ation. \n3.22. Reserves are unc ommitted forces and assets , that are held on standby at t he \ncommander's disposal. Reserves  are employed to force the decision, t o fac ilitate a shift of the \nmain effort or to ov ercome critical situations. They can be key to success, especially in \ncombat. The initiative can often be retained or gained only by their employment. Reserves \nare the most important a nd often the last means a c ommander has available to react to \nunforeseen developments or decisively influence the c ourse of an operation. A reserve must \nbe established for all oper ations  and activities at battalion level and above.\n3.23. Brigade Tactical Check Notes.  The following ex tracts from AFM Part 3 are enclosed:  \n•Attack: •Stability Activities\n•Attack: Exploitation & Pursuit •Advance  to Contact\n•Delay •Forward Passage of Lines\n•Area Defence •Relief in Place\n•Mobile Defence •Rearward Passage of Lines\nCheck Notes – Attack  \n•Attack.  An attack comprises a sequence of assaults, supported by suppressive fire\nuntil the objective is secured. The attack must concentrate forces against the enemy’s\nidentified weaknesses and be conducted in such a way that it is possible to neutralis e\nenem\ny counter -attacks. The momentum of the attack should be continuous without any\nsignificant pause to maintain pressure on the enemy and force them to be reactive.\nFigure 3.9 Execution of Attack  \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 10 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Purpose  \nThe purpos e of an attac k is to destroy the enemy ’s capabilit y to fight and subsequentl y to \ndestr oy the enemy ’s will and cohesion. There are four types of attack:  \n• Deliberate : To defeat  a well-prepared enem y. The emphasi s is on preparation  at the expens e of spee d \nand time,  therefore  methods  other  than speed  will be required in order to achiev e surprise.  \n• hasty : Seek s to take advantage  of the enemy ’s lack of preparedness , and involve s boldness , surpris e, \nand speed  in order to achiev e success  before  the enem y has had time to balanc e the force. \n• Spoiling : To disrup t a hostil e attac k while the enem y is in the proces s of formin g up or assembling  \nfor an attack.  \n• Counter : To regain lost ground , isolat e or destroy enem y force elements . It denies  the enem y the \nattainmen t of the purpos e in attacking.  \nPrinciples  \n• Surprise  \n• Concentration of force  • Security  \n• Exploit success \nGroupings  \nReconnaissanc e force: \n• Critical to successful manoeuvre  \n• Determines routes, enemy information, \ndefensive gaps, obstacles, presence of \nother actors  \n• Can be used to maintain momentum, \nconduct exploitation, provide security  \n• Reconnaissance pull  \nAssaul t force: \n• Strength and task organisation will depend on nature of mission Securit y force: \n• Conducts flank protection, gap coverage, rear area and \noperating base security  \n• Fixes bypassed enemy  \nEchelo n force: \n• Tasked to exploit success  \n• Will have a specific mission – though actual tasks may \nnot be fully understood at start  \n• Maintains momentum  \nReserve : \n• Uncommitted - to deal with the unexpected \n• Structure and size will depend on situation and mission  \n• Prepare  to reconstitut e after commitment  \nSequence : An attac k can be divide d into a number  of distinct , but closel y relate d stages , which will tend \nto merge.

It is characterised by a rapid advance against lessening resistance and its effects are both \nphysical and psychological.    \nThe purpose of a pursuit . The pursuit seeks to catch or cut off an enemy who fears envelopment \nand who is demoralised and beginning to disintegrate under pressure.  \nPrinciples  \n• Maintain the initiative  \n• Exploit manoeuvre  • Balance  \nGroupings  \nExploitation  \n• Exploitation force  \n• Security force Reserve  Pursuit  \n• Pursuing force  \n• Blocking force  \n• Security force  \n• Reserve  \nSequence  \nExploitation  \n• Maintain pressure . The exploitation \nforce maintains contact with the \nenemy on a broad front, preventing \nforces from reorganising for defence, \nconducting counter -attacks or \nwithdrawing effectively.  \n• Transition to pursuit . As pressure \non the enemy intensifies and they \nbegin to disintegrate, the \ncommander may order the transition to a pursuit  Pursuit  \n• Maintain pressure . The pursuing force conducts attacks \non the enemy to force the enemy to turn and fight to \nenable the blocking force to manoeuvre into position.  \n• Manoeuvre and block. The blocking force advances \nalong parallel routes (ground and/or air) to the enemy’s \nline of retreat.

A delay  is conducted  to avoid battle in \nunfavourabl e conditions , to slow an enemy ’s   advance,  to inflict damage,  to gathe r informatio n without  \ngiving informatio n away, and withou t itself becoming decisivel y engaged . The commander  shoul d know  \neither  the minimu m lengt h of time that they must delay  based  on the time required to reconstitut e forces \nto the rear to allow other activitie s to take place,  the percentage  of enem y forces that must be destroyed , \nor the percentage  of the force that must be preserved  base d on the subsequen t tasks.  \nPrinciples  \n• Offensive action  \n• Deception  • Simplicity  \n• Freedom of action  • Maintain contact  \nGroupings  \nSecurity Force  \nSecurity forces will usually consist of \nreconnaissance task -organised with ISR, aviation \nreconnaissance and strike, and joint fires,  anti-\ntank and other fire support assets. All elements \nmust be mobile.  Delaying Force  \nDelaying forces will usually \nconsist of armoured and \narmoured infantry forces \nwith mobility/counter -\nmobility support, joint fires, \nand aviation strike assets.  Reserves \nReserves should be \navailable with sufficient \nmobility and combat power \nto support the delaying \nforces.  \nConduct  Sequence  \nDelay from:  \n• Alternate positions  \n• Subsequent positions  • Shaping and preparation  \n• Delaying action  \n• Breaking contact  \n \n \n 1. The screen force seeks to identify enemy axes and strengths and tracks them back to the main delaying \nforce where it breaks clean and move rearwards for subsequent tasking.  \n2. The delaying force prepares positions from which to delay. If time allows this may include obstacles and \ndummy positions.  \n3. The delaying force fights the delay battle from successive or alternate positions.  \n4. Offensive action should be conducted wherever possible including local counter attacks against fleeting \nopportunities or planned strikes against depth targets using assets such as AH.  \n5. On completion of the delay the force is likely to hand over to another formation to the rear. Where this \noccurs on an obstacle, reserved demolitions can be usefully employed.  \n \nFigure 4.7 Delay \nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 17 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Delay Continued:  \nDelay Planning Considerations by Tactical Function\nCommand  \n•S election of method of delay\n•C redible and resourced deception plan\n•D esignation of which terrain will be used by the\ndelaying force\n•Li aison between all levels and flanking\nformation to ensure mutual support\n•E ffective task organisation for security and\ndelaying force\n•Selection of battle positions (primary, secondary\nand alternate)\n•U nderstanding enhanced through organise d\nr\neconnaissance and uninterrupte d\nc\nommunications\n•U nderstanding of risk and its articulation at all\nlevels\n•Loc ation of the commander during th e\nex\necution – use of tactical CP\n•Loc ation and protection of main CP\n•E ngineer priorities for mobility and counter -\nmobility tasks as directed by the commander t o\ns\nupport the plan\no Improvement/maintenance of rtes\no Use of assault bridging\no Enhancement and construction of\nobstacles\no Establishment of reserved demolitions\no Survivability tasks\no Dummy positions\no Clearance of fields of fire\n•D eception plan to include dummy positions,\nfalse routine\n•D esignation of KA supported with obstacles\n•C ontrol of the battle handover line betwee n\ns\necurity force and delaying force (RPOL an d\nCI\nD)\n•Loc al reserve located to be able to support\ncounter -penetration and attack the enemy\n•C losure of gaps and lanes within the barrier\nplan\n•Ma intenance of a COP to aid SA and decision\nmaking.\n•Informed by CCIR to inform DPs and movement\nof forces.\n•J udgement of the time to disengage and break\nclean from the enemy – linked to DPs informe d\nby\n CCIR\n•C ontrol of the handover line\n•Ma intenance of moralIntelligence  \n•Identify key terrain and vital ground through IPE\nand reconnaissance\n•Loc ation of natural obstacles:\no Bridges\no Defiles\no Water features\no Restricted/severely restricted terrain\no Gaps to be enhanced through the barrier\nplan\n•E nemy intent and dispositions\no Size and composition\no Rtes\no OS (Arty)  locations  and reaction times\no ISR capabilities\no Reserve\n•A ir/Avn capabilities (descant ops)\n•Divisional ISR will locate and track the enemy in \nthe deep before handing over the close\n•Ma intenance of a COP – prevent the enemy\nfrom exploiting the seams and gaps between\nformations\n•Maintenance of STAP through all phases and i n\nconditions of limited visibility and at night\nSERIAL 1-02-03 \n1–02–03 - 18 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Delay Continued:  \nDelay Planning Considerations by Tactical Function  (continued)\nManoeuvre  \n•P reliminary moves to allow reconnaissance,\nrehearsals and battle procedure\n•D elaying forces need to be mobile, balanced,\nand capable of independent action\n•Max imise depth to delay the enemy\n•O bstacle plan – obstacles and barriers\ncovered by observation and fire (conforms to\nthe divisional plan)\n•R eserved demolition location and firing states\n•C amouflage and concealment of battl e\npos\nitions, hides and CPs\n•S ecurity force to slow enemy rate of advance,\ndeceive, degrade, dislocate and delay (HOTO\nfrom divisional assets)\n•P revent penetration by the enemy throug h\nl\nocal counter - attacks to ensure freedom of\nmanoeuvre\n•A  dedicated flank protection force may b e\nr\nequired\n•Gaps in the defence should where possible be \ncovered by ISR or mitigated against\n•U se of local counter -attacks to break clean\n•Generation of local reserve within the delaying\nforceFires \n•I ntegrated and coordinated fire plan:\no Employment of divisional fires\no FSCM to prevent fratricide\n•T argeting of enemy reconnaissance and ISR\nassets\n•J oint firers to support the security force/ delaying\nforce break clean\n•U se of AH to conduct attacks and ambushes t o\nd\negrade enemy capability.

This summary is taken from JDP 0- 30 UK Air Power  3rd Ed (2022) and AP3002 Air \nWarfare 5th Ed (Sep 2023). \n4.2. What is Air Power ? The fundamental purpose of military air power is achieving \nmastery of the  air.  Air power is  defined as: “ the ability to use air capabilities in and from the \nair, to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events .” (JDP 0 -30 Para 1. 2) \n4.3. Fundamental Characteristics of  Air Power . (JDP 0 -30 from Para 1.4) \n•Height –enables aviators to observe, and deliver, activities in the land and maritime\nenvironments .\n•Speed – enables the rapid and responsive projection of power .\n•Reach – enables adversaries to be influenced, regardless of their location.\nWhile height, speed and reach represent core air power characteristics in their own right, \nthey act together synergistically to produce additional characteristics:  \n•Agility – a blend of responsiveness, adaptability, flexibility and resilience using multi-\nrole & multi- mission capabilities .\n•Ubiquity  – Height, speed and reach, combined with the agility of air  capabilities,\nprovide air power with ubiquity .\n•Concentration - concentrate military force in time and space, when and where it is\nrequired.\n4.4. The Air Environment .  The air environment is an unforgiving one and, thus, aircraft \nare designed to meet the challenges of operating at a variety of altitudes, temperature extremes and speed ranges . \n4.5. Limitations of Air Power . (JDP 0 -30 from Para 1.10 ) \n•Impermanence.  Aircraft cannot yet stay airborne indefinitely. Although the use of\nair-to-air refuelling can extend the range and endurance of aircraft.\n•Limited payload . The payloads that can be carried by aircraft are limited i\nn\nc\nomparison with ships or land vehicles .\n•Fragility . Structurally, aircraft are highly stressed and built to be as light as\npracticable, carrying little or no armour protection; thus, relatively low levels  of battl e\ndam\nage may have a catastrophic effect .\n•Cost .  Many military aircraft use cutting- edge technology, which, inevitably, comes at\nsignificant financial cost .\n•Basing and overflight .  All forms of military power depend on basing, support  and\npr\notection; aircraft are no exception .\n•Weather .  Poor weather may still create some difficulties, but modern technology means\nthat the majority of military aircraft can now operate in all light conditions, day and night,\nregardless of weather conditions .\n4.\n6. Manned / Crewed Aircraft .  Crewed  combat aircraft are categorised according to \ntheir ‘generation’ which broadly reflects their capabilities. A generational shift in combat \naircraft occurs when a technological innovation cannot be incorporated into an existing \naircraft through upgrade. Although there are currently five broadly accepted generations, \nmost NATO air forces are equipped with fourth and fifth generation aircraft.  \n•Third Generation .  Third generation aircraft form the bulk of most non- western air\nforces, originally entering service during the 1970s and 1980s.  These were multi -role\nai\nrcraft  capable of supersonic flight and engaging targets beyond visual range.  This\ngeneration includes the Mig- 27 Flogger and Mirage III.\n•Fourth Generation .  Fourth generation aircraft are those designed to bridge the  gap\nbet\nween the developments of the 1970s and those entering service after 2000.\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Typically, aircraft from this generation employed fly -by-wire systems and digital \nprocessing for enhanced on- board sensors  and the ability to employ precision \nweaponry. This generation includes the Typhoon, F -15 Eagle, Mig- 29 Fulcrum and \nSu-27 Flanker.  \n• Fifth Generation .  Fifth generation aircraft combine new developments such as \ncomposite materials, low observable technology, advanced electronically scanned \nradars and sensor fusion to greatly improve pilot situational awareness. This \ngeneration includes  aircraft such as the B -2 Spirit; F -22 and F- 35. \n4.7. Unmanned Aircraft .  An unmanned  aircraft is an aircraft that does not carry a \nhuman operator and is operated remotely using varying levels of automated functions. Unmanned aircraft can be expendable or recoverable, they may carry a lethal or non- lethal \npayload.  Cruise missiles are not considered unmanned aircraft.   Due to the lack of a \nrequirement to accommodate a human being, unmanned aircraft can be significantly smaller \nthan manned aircraft, thus the range of sizes can be greater than that of manned a ircraft. \nUnmanned aircraft are  categorised as follows:  \n• Class One (Less than 150kg) - includes three sub classifications -  Micro, Mini and \nSmall, all generally used at tactical level.  \n• Class Two (150 -  600kg) . \n• Class Three (600kg+) . \n \nFigure 4.1 NATO UAS  Classification  \nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 4.8. Fundamental Air Power Roles . \nThe f our fundamental air power roles are: \n•Control of the Air  (Counter Air).\n•Attack.\n•Intelligence, Surveillance &\nReconnaissance.\n•Air Mobility .\nThese four roles can be conducted in \nisolation, combined or, more usually, as part of multi -domain operations within a \ncomprehensive approach, these roles \ncontribute to persistent influence and \ndeterrence activities as well as to the \ndirect task assigned.  \n4.9. Airpower  Enablers:  the ability to \ndeliver each of the four air power roles is \ndependent on critical enablers: base; \nsustain; C4I connect; and protect . (JDP 0 -30 Ch 4.) \nCONTROL OF THE AIR - Secures our joint freedom of manoeuvre. \n4.10.  Terminology. Operationally, control of the air is achieved via \ncounter -air operations; a term that is also used by NATO and the United \nStates Air Force to describe the over -arching air power role.  \n4.11.  Control of the Air Definition : “freedom, over a given period of \ntime, to use a volume of airspace for our own purposes while, if necessary, denying or constraining its use by an opponent” .  (AP3002 Para  501). \n4.12.  Purpose:  Control of the air is the most important air power role because it secures  \nour joint freedom of manoeuvre.  At the operational level, it assures military freedom of \nmanoeuvre in the air, land or maritime domains. This allows our commanders to seize the \ninitiative while denying it to an adversary.  The breakdown of control of the air is depicted in \nFigure 5.2 below.   \n4.13.  Degrees of Control of the Air :  NATO recognises three  levels of control:  \n•Air parity . Air parity exists where no force enjoys decisive control of the air in either\ntime or space. Consequently, both friendly and adversary land, maritime and air\nforces may encounter significant interference by the opposing force.\n•Air Superiority : That degree of dominance in the air battle of one force over another,\nwhich permits the conduct of operations by the former, and its related maritime, l\nand\nand ai\nr forces at a given time and place, without prohibitive interference by the\nopposing force.\n•Air Supremacy:  The degree of air superiority where the opposing air force is\nincapable of effective interference.  It is important to note that even air supremacy\ncannot guarantee that an adversary will not inflict some damage or losses,particularly given the extensive proliferation of small arms weapons and man-\nportable air defences. This is normally the highest level of control of the air that ajoint force can achieve. (JDP 0 -30 Para 2.3 a, b & c).\nFigure 4.2 The Roles of Air Power  \n\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 4.14.  Executing Control \nof the Air .  Control of the \nair is not a permanent state \nand constant activity is \nrequired to achieve it. To \ngain and maintain the required degree of control \nof the air, counter -air \noperations are conducted to disrupt, degrade, deny or \ndestroy an adversary’s ability to challenge such \ncontrol. Counter -air \noperations comprise two key missions: offensive \ncounter -air (OCA) and Air & \nMissile Defence  (AMD) \nwhich is also known as defensive counter -air \n(DCA).  (JDP 0 -30 Para 2. 4) \n4.15.  Airspace Control :  \nThe goal of airspace control is to increase combat effectiveness of all \ncomponents by promoting \nthe safe, efficient and \nflexible use of airspace \nthrough the Airspace Control Plan.  \n4.16.  Counter Air \nOperations - Offensive \nversus Defensive Counter -\nAir Balance: \n•Offensive is proactive, defensive is responsive .\n•Preferred approach is to use offensive counter air operations to destroy or disruptenemy before they launch aircraft or missiles\n.\n4.\n17. Offensive Counter Air (OCA) .  (AP3002 from Para 514) \n•Surface attack .  OCA surface attack operations target an adversary’s air and missil e\nc\napabilities on the ground and their supporting military infrastructure. They employ\nair-to-surface and surface- to-surface fires and may also employ capabilities i n\nc\nyberspace when authorized. Surface attacks are frequently employed as the initial\nmissions within an overall counter -air campaign . Typical targets include the following:\noAirfields .\noAircraft .\noOperating Surfaces .\noC2 Faci lities.\noPower\noAirfield Defenc es.\noSurface based early warning syste ms.\noC2.\noTheatre Ballistic Missiles.\nFigure 4.3 The Hierarchy of \nControl of the Air Activities  \nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Fi\nghter Escort High Value Asset Attack .\noFighter  Sweep .  Utilising AD- capable aircraft to sweep through a designat ed\nar\nea of enemy airspace to sanitize the airspace of any air -to-air threat . There\nar\ne two types:\nArea Sweep\nRoute Sweep\noFighter Escort .  Protection mission to protect vulnerable aircraft packages .\nThe escor t can be detached from the aircraft package, embedded or clos e\nand i\nncluded HVAA (High Value Air Asset) protection.   There are three types:\nDetached Escort .\nClose Escort .\nOrganic Escort .\n•Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) .  As part of counter -air operations,\nSEAD missions are carried out to protect friendly aircraft from the threat posed by an\nadversary’s surface - based AD (SBAD) systems; primarily SAMs. These systems\nmay be part of an elaborate and well- integrated AD organisation (typically referred to\nas an integrated AD system (IADS)) . There are two approaches  to suppression.\noDestruction.  Kinetic d estruction of an adversary’s IADS or its components is\npreferable to temporarily suppressing it; it removes a threat and reduces sorti e\nr\nequirements, frees crews and aircraft whilst increasing the safety factor of\nfuture attack missions.\noDisruption.  Disruption in the form of electronic/cyber denial, degradation,\ndeception, delay or  neutralisation of an adversary’s AD systems can\ntemporarily increase aircraft  survivability; however, the effects will usually  be\nof\n a limited duration.\noCategories of SEAD Operations :\nArea Suppression.\nLocalised Suppression.\nOpportune Suppression.\n•High -value Airborne Asset Attack (HVAAA) .  HVAAA uses air -to-air capabl e\nai\nrcraft to attack an adversary’s critical airborne assets such as AEW, AWACS, AAR\nor electronic warfare (EW) aircraft, to either destroy them or force them to retrogr ade\n(\nmove from their operational location, thereby reducing their effectiveness) .\n4.18.  Air and Missile Defence Operations (AMD)  also known as Defensive Counter -\nAir (DCA) .  At the operational -level and tactical level, DCA & AMD are effectively \nindistinguishable,  and the terms may be used inter -changeably.  AMD consists of all active \nand passive operations to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy or negate adversary air and missile forces attempting to attack or penetrate friendly battlespace, or to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of such attacks should attackers escape destruction. The Air & M issile \nDefence Commander  is responsible for the  integration of all air defence  efforts regardless of \nsystem ownership . primarily carried out over friendly territory and, unlike OCA, may take \nplace at any point on the spectrum of conflict; from early warning and air policing in peacetime through to inflicting maximum attrition on an adversary’s attacking air and missile forces during combat operations. (AP3002 Para 521). \n•Active AMD . This  involves any direct defensive action taken to destroy, nullify or\nreduce the effectiveness of adversary air and missile attack against friendly forces\nand critical elements. It is achieved through integrated detection, identification,\nassessment, interception and engagement and usually characterised by layer\ned\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 6 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 defence- in-depth affording multiple engagement opportunities, utilising reactive air -\nto-air capable fighters, SAMs and other assets placed on airborne or ground alert . \n• Passive AMD .  This  includes all other measures taken to minimise the effectiveness \nof hostile air and missile attacks. Elements of passive AMD include: detection and \nearly warning; camouflage, concealment and deception; hardening, dispersal and \nrecuperation; redundancy; mobility; and chemical biological radiological and nuclear \n(CBRN) preparations.  \nATTACK-  which can coerce and influence actors into changing or  \nmaintaining behaviour.  (AP3002 from Para 601). \n4.19.  Purpose:  Air attack lies at the heart of air power’s capacity to \ncreate influence by changing behaviours  or the course of events. It is a \ncoercive activity as it creates tactical, operational and strategic effects through the threat, and use, of force.   \n4.20.  Strategic attack . To conduct actions to achieve coercive or decisive effects by \ndisrupting an adversary’s strategic ability or will to carry out aggressive activity and other \nundesirable actions.   It is achieved through the disruption or destruction of an adversary’s \ncentre(s) of gravity, or other vital target sets.  \n4.21.  Counter -Land .  Air operations is to gain and maintain a desired degree of control of \nthe battlefield by targeting fielded adversary ground forces and the infrastructure directly \nsupporting them.  It comprises:  \n• Air Interdiction (AI) .  Actions taken to destroy, disrupt, divert or delay the \nadversary’s surface forces before they can be used effectively against friendly forces. \nAI is carried out at such distance from friendly forces that detailed integration of each \nair mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces is not required.  Either:  \no Pre-planned, or  \no Immediate (Armed recce, airborne alert , Kill box interdiction  & SCAR )  \n \n• Close Air Support  (CAS) .  Action by fixed- wing and rotary -wing aircraft against \nadversary forces in close proximity to friendly forces, and thus requires detailed \nintegration of each air mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces for \nfratricide avoidance and targeting guidance.  Either:  \no Pre-planned (scheduled & on- call). \no Immediate  CAS. \no Push  CAS. \nFigure 4.4 The Range \nof Air Attack Activities  \n\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 o Emergency CAS. \n• CAS versus AI. \no Where in the battlespace:  \n CAS usually occurs between the FLOT and the FSCL; AI occurs beyond \nthe FSCL  \no The degree of coordination required:  \n The degree of coordination required for CAS is greater due to the close \nproximity of the target to friendly forces. The coordination required refers \nto the detailed integration with the fire and movement of other forces.   \n As AI is conducted beyond the FSCL, detailed integration with friendly forces is not required.  \no Realisation of effects:   \n AI effects can take days or even weeks to be perceived, whilst CAS effects are felt almost immediately . \no Risk and Return : \n Generally speaking CAS targets tend to be high risk, (due to their position \nin the battlespace and their proximity to adversary forces) low return (single tanks or APCs) but are often high priority particularly for the troops on the ground   \no Efficient use of Air :  \n CAS is a less efficient use of joint air power than AI as the returns are generally lower than those undertaking AI.   \n \n4.22.  Counter -maritime .  Uses air power to extend the application of air attack into the \nhigh seas, or the littoral and its adjacent waters. Such operations range from strategic attack \nto AI and CAS, through to specific maritime- orientated underwater warfare and surface \nwarfare:  \n• Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) .  Air operations to search for, locate, classify, track \nand attack submarines and their support assets, at sea or in port, to deny the \nadversary  the effective use of submarines.  \n• Surface Warfare (ASuW) .  Air operations to ensure the detection and engagement \nof enemy naval surface forces and merchant ships to deny their effectives employment.   Aircraft may be used for  the detection, location, identification, \nrecognition, reporting and engagement of surface vessels.  \nINTELLIGENCE , SURVEILLANCE  & RECONNAISSANCE (ISR) . \nInforms the development of understanding across all domains.   \n(AP3002 from Para 701)  \n4.23.  Purpose:  The intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance \n(ISR) process is a framework through which a single collection requirement is satisfied by an \nISR asset and employs the 4- step intelligence cycle: direction; collection; processing  and \ndissemination (DCPD). These steps apply at all levels of command, across components, for \nany type of mission and in all operational environments. While ISR activities are not unique \nto air and space operations, the fundamental attributes of air and space power make aircraft \nand satellites ideally suited to the ISR collect role. .   \n• ISR is focused implicitly, rather than explicitly, on decision- making.  \n•  ISTAR can be thought of as applied ISR. It uses the output from the ISR process to \nsupport tactical level activity, specifically targeting and the creation of effects .   \nThe Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance  role consists of 3 linked inform functions :  \n\nSERIAL 1-02-04 \n1–02–04 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 4.24.  Intelligence (different from information) .  Intelligence is the product resulting from the \ndirected collection and processing of information regarding the environment and the \ncapabilities and intentions of actors, in order to identify threats and offer opportunities for \nexploitation by decision- makers.  It consists of the five TCPED steps  shown in Fig 4.5. \n4.25.  Surveillance (routine observation) .  Continuing and systematic observation.   Not \norientated towards specific target but provides warnings and detects changes.  \n4.26.  Reconnaissance (targeted activity) .  Compliments surveillance through visual \nobservation or other detection methods to obtain specific information about activities and resources.  \n4.27.  Traditional Reconnaissance (ISR/IST AR) This is delivered by dedicated large ISR \nair platforms  designed and operated for this specific purpose , often with multiple crew \nmembers  conducting analysis . Examples include:  \n•E-3D Sentry.\n Long\nr\nange conventional\nradar alongsi de\npr\novision of  airborne\nC2.\n•RC-135 Rivet Joint.\nSIGINT.\n•Shadow R1. EO/IR.\n•Islander andDefender.

Non-traditional \nReconnaissance \n(ISR/IST AR) is delivered by \ncombat air platforms with purpose -built pods fitted with imagery intelligence (IMMINT) and \nother sensors.   Examples include: \n•Multirole aircraft  – F35 Lightning / Typhoon .\n•Attack Helicopters – AH-64 Apache / AH-1Z Viper .\n•ISR - focused implicitly, rather than explicitly, on decision -making.  Utility of the\ndefinition lies fundamentally at the strategic and operational levels  and predominates\nwithin joint and air doctrine. The correct application and fusing of ISR products c an\npr\novide information advantage which, in turn,  can identify opportunities within the full -\nspectrum targeting process.\n•ISTAR  - can be thought of as applied ISR. It uses the output from the ISR  process to\nsupport tactical level activity, specifically targeting and the creation  of effects.

Provides the ability to deploy, sustain and recover \npersonnel and equipment, often over significant distance.  \n(AP3002 from Para 801) \n4.29.  Purpose:  Air mobility provides the ability to deploy, sustain and \nrecover personnel and equipment, often over significant distance.  Air \nmobility operations are generally classified as inter - or intra- theatre,  and both may be \nconducted simultaneously .  The Air Mobility role uses the following activities:   \n4.30.  Airlift .  Airlift is the ability to transport personnel, equipment and materiel through the \nair.  It has a number of employment options:  \n•Hub and Spoke.   Aircraft fly into a central point (hub) and then distributed in theatre\nalong ‘spokes’.    Integrates  inter and intra theatre airlift.\noInter -theatre .  Provides air -bridge that links theatres or JOAs to the\nhomeland or to other theatres.   Provided by heavy strategic air transport.\nSupplemented by chartered airlift.   Augmented by tactical range air transport.\noIntra -theatre .  Provides air movement within a specific theatre  or JOA.\nFulfilled by tactical fixed wing aircraft or rotary wing support helicopters.\nInvolves operations in tactical conditions, including small. Austere and\nunimproved field operations.\n•Aeromedical Evacuation.Uses air assets to transportinjured personnel, under\nmedical supervision, t\no\nm\nedical facilities.\n•Airborne Operations.\nTransports airborne combat\nforces directly onto, or near\ntheir objectiv e and\ns\nubsequently sustain or\nextricate them.

Personnel Recovery  (PR). The term personnel recovery (PR) is used to describe \nthe recovery and reintegration of captured, missing or isolated personnel, during both \npeacetime and on operations, from uncertain or hostile environments through air enabled \nsearch and rescue (SAR), com bat recovery (CR). The principal parameters that dictate \nhow a recovery mission is conducted are the location of the isolated individual(s) and the \nlevel of threat posed.  \n• Peacetime Recovery . \no Search and Rescue  (SAR) .  Recover y of personnel in distress where hostile \ninterference is not  expected. This can include mountain rescue.  \no Deployed search and Rescue. These are SAR operations conducted \noutside the home nation as part of a disaster relief or humanitarian operation, \nor in support of a training exercise, where no hostile interference is expected.  \n• Combat Recovery.  \no Combat Recovery.   Recovery of non -detained isolated personnel from a \nsituation where  hostile interference may be expected, using conventional \ntactics, techniques  and procedures.  \no Combat Search & Rescue (CSAR) .  Recovery of non- detained isolated \npersonnel from a situation where hostile interference may be expected, using \nforces that are nationally designated and specifically trained and equipped to  \nconduct recovery.  \no Non-conventional Assisted Recovery . In the highest threat environments, \nrecoveries may be conducted through non- conventional assisted recovery \nmeans using SF or surrogate/indigenous forces that have been trained or equipped to assist in moving isolated personnel through a network that \nreturns them to the safety of friendly forces.  \n \n \nFigure 4.7 The Person nel Recovery Spectrum  \nSERIAL 1-02-05 \n1–02–05 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 SPACE DOCTRINE FUNDAMENTALS  \n5.1. This summary is taken from JDP 0- 40 UK Space Power  1st Ed (2022)   \n5.2. What is Space?  There is no agreement under international law as to the altitude at \nwhich airspace ends and outer space begins. From a practical perspective, outer space (the \nfinal frontier! !) begins  ‘above the highest altitude at which an aircraft can fly and below the \nlowest possible perigee of a satellite in orbit’.   This point is commonly known as the Kármán \nLine: a height approximately 100 kilometres above mean sea level, above which the \natmosphere becomes too thin for an aircraft to generate conventional lift without needing to \nexceed the speed required to achieve orbit. Thus, for practical purposes, anything in orbit or \nbeyond can safely be regarded as being in space.  \n5.3. Space as an Operational Domain.   Space is contested by both state and non- state \nactors. It is subject to expanding commercial competition and is congested by a growing \nvolume of satellites and debris. Increasing reliance on space, identified vulnerabilities and \nthe perception of challenge in space necessitated it  to be considered an operational domain.  \n5.4. What is Space Power ?  Space power is defined as: “exerting influence in, from, or \nthrough, space. ” (JDP 0 -40 Para 1. 3) \n5.5. Attributes  of the Space Domain . (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1.5) \n• Congested.   Traditionally, the use and exploration of space was only undertaken by \nthe major powers. In recent times, the lowering of technological the traditional \nbarriers and costs have trigger ed commercial expansion into space on an \nunparalleled scale.  \n• Complex .  The blurring of the lines between civilian and military, government and \ncommercial has drastically increased complexity in space.  \n• Critical .  Technological advances, underpinned by increasingly widespread \ncommercial or dual -use space capabilities, have imperceptibly permeated society \nand popular culture to such an extent that they are now almost indispensable, but \nthey are nonetheless taken almost completely for granted.  – eg GPS.  \n• Contested.  Many adversaries have space programmes themselves  and can source \ncapabilities commercially or have at least identified space to be a critical vulnerability . \n5.6. Aspects of the Space Domain .  It should be stressed that the following aspects \ncannot be taken in isolation: each affects and relies on the others.   (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1.7) \n• Political Aspects : \no Diplomatic .  To supports the growth of a commercial space sector . \no International Negotiations . To prevent an arms race in space  \no Legal .  The international legal framework for space is the Outer Space Treaty . \n• Military Aspects.  Most  military operations could not be sustained without space \ncapabilities .  Operations depend on space, principally for communications; \nmeteorological; positioning, navigation and timing functions; intelligence, surveillance \nand reconnaissance; and the ability to operate remotely piloted aircraft at range.  \n• Economic Aspects.   A thriving commercial space sector is valuable to Defence both \nfor developing innovative projects that offer the potential of delivering decisive \nmilitary advantage but also to reduce the costs and increase the capacity and \navailability of existing systems . \n• Social Aspects.   All modern states, depends on space services for day ‑to‑day \nsocietal functions such as enabling banking transactions, the effective operation of \nthe national power grid and the use of smartphones. However, the public are often unaware of this, or take assured access for granted, making it difficult to \nacknowledge our reliance on freedom of access to the space environment.  \n• Information Aspects.   The free flow of data and seamless functioning of networks \nare critical for space functions, both for control signals and the operation of payloads.  \nSERIAL 1-02-05 \n1–02–05 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Infrastructure Aspects.   Space operations are separated into three segments to aid \nunderstanding of the space system . \no Space segment . The space segment comprises elements of the space \nsystem in outer space itself .  There are t wo basic systems: the spacecraft \nitself and the payloads it carries. This differentiation is important as the two \ncan have different software, systems, ground segment elements and tasking \nchains.  \no Ground segment . The ground segment comprises terrestrial facilities that \nare used to launch, direct and control satellites as well as operate their \npayloads.  \no Link segment . The link segment connects the space and ground segments \nand comprises both the data itself and the medium used to carry it.  \n• Physical Environment Aspects .  The environment encountered by a spacecraft on \norbit can be extremely harsh, given it lacks the protection afforded terrestrial domains \nby the Earth’s atmosphere.   Three areas:  \no Orbits and orbital mechanics.  \no The space environment . Temperature, magnetic fields & vacuum.  \no Space Debris .  Tens of thousands of objects in orbit >  10cm  = impacts . \no Space Weather .  The sun’s activity causes solar flares, coronal mass \nejections and radiation storms.  \no Time .  Every satellite launched has a finite operational lifetime based on the \nfuel it carries and which it needs to operate its systems and manoeuvre to \nmaintain the orbit parameters it is launched on . \n5.7. Characteristics of Space Power . (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1.19) \n• Perspective . As with the air domain, space capabilities exploit the vertical \ndimension, albeit to a completely different order of magnitude.  \n• Access. The international rules and norms governing overflight of sovereign states by aircraft do not apply to satellites; space offers unrivalled access to any point on \nEarth, with no requirement to adhere to national boundaries.  \n• \nPersistence. Typically, the orbital life expectancy of satellites is measured in years or \neven decades, so they can overcome the air power limitation of impermanence.  \n• Versatility. Space assets are versatile because a single platform can carry a \nmultitude of sensors and capabilities to provide services simultaneously to multiple \nusers.  \n5.8. Limitations of Space Power . (JDP 0 -40 from Para 1. 20) \n• Cost . While the traditional cost barriers for space systems have dramatically \nreduced, they are still expensive.  \n• Vulnerability. Space systems possess vulnerabilities across all three segments.  \n• Predictability . Objects in space do not fly like aircraft, rather they fall in accordance \nwith the laws of orbital mechanics. Satellite orbits are therefore mostly predictable.  \n• Limited responsiveness. While limited responsiveness is still valid when \nconsidering larger exquisite capabilities (which are few in number and take years and \nsometimes decades to build and replace), increasingly, the ease with which small, \nalmost disposable satellites can be built and launched may mitigate this limitation to \nsome degree.  \n• Orbit congestion . While space itself is vast, the laws of orbital mechanics mean that \ncertain orbits, especially geosynchronous equatorial orbit  (GEO ), are extremely \nvaluable. Orbit slots in GEO are regulated by the International Telecommunication \nUnion . \n \nSERIAL 1-02- 05 \n1–02– 05 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 5.9. Space Power \nRoles.  The f our \nfundamental space  \npower roles are  shown \nin Figure 5B1.  They \nare a good framework within which to view \nactivity in space; \nhowever, they are not \nabsolute and overlap \nbetween the roles will inevitably occur.  \n5.10.  Space domain \nawareness .

Informally (and in its very basic terms) successful logistics \ncomprises having materiel or services:  \n• in the right quantity;\n• in the right condition;\n• in the right place; and\n• at the right time.\n6.3. Logistics is defined in NATO as: “Logistics is the science of planning and carrying \nout the movement and maintenance of forces. In its most comprehensive sense, the aspects \nof military operations which deal with:  \n• design and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution,\nmaintenance, recovery and disposal of materiel;\n• transport of personnel;\n• acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of\nfacilities;• acquisition or furnishing of services; and\n• medical and health service support.”\n6.4. NATO Principles of Logistics: \n• Authority;\n• Primacy of operational requirements;\n• Coordination and cooperation;\n• Assured provision;\n• Sufficiency;\n• Efficiency;\n• Simplicity;\n• Flexibility;\n• Visibility.\nOperational -level Logistics Command & \nControl : \n6.5.

Based on strategic \nguidance issued by the joint commander, \nthe JTFHQ J4 Staff:  \n• Sets theatre logistic policy;\n• Establishes the logistic a\nnd\nm\novement priorities within the\njoint operations area;\n• Monitors the recognised theatre logistic picture.\n• The JTFHQ will have discrete cells for:\noSupply;\noMovement and transportation;\noEquipment support;\noContractors on deployed operations (condo);\noContracted logistics; and\noMedical support.\nFigure 6. 1   Logistic C2 in the JTF  \nSERIAL 1-02-06 \n1–02–06 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 6.6. Logistics Component HQ  (LogCHQ).  LogCHQ may be deployed as the joint \nlogistic command and control node (subordinate to the JTFHQ).  A LogCHQ provides a \nsingle joint focus for all logistic activity supporting the deployed joint task force. The \nheadquarters has particular responsibility for the reception, staging and onward \nmovement66 of force elements in the joint operations area and sustainment of the operation.  \n6.7.

Military Capability is the enduring ability to generate a desired \noperational outcome or effect, which is relative to the threat, physical environment, and \ncontributions of coalition partners. Military Capability is the Means, which is applied by the Ways to achieve the Ends.  \n7.2. There are 4 key aspects to a  military capability:  \n• The PLANNING  and analysis of what capability Defence need s and can afford.\n• The DESIGN  and DELIVERY  of the capability into Service.\n• The GENERATION of capability for operations, its deployment and\nsustainment .\n• The SUPPORT  of military capability  through its life.\n7.3. CADMID Cycle .   The life -cycle of a capability takes it through a number of key \nstages. These stages are grouped together under the acronym CADMID which stands for:  \nC\noncept – Assessment – Demonstration – Manufacture - In Service - Disposal  \nFigure 7.1   The CADMID Cycle  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Each of the six acquisition phases involves executing the plan agreed in the previous phase, \nreviewing the outcome, and planning for the remaining phases.  The basic activities of each \nphase are as follows:  \na. Concept Stage: The development of the User Requirement Document \n(URD) that provides a baseline statement of the outputs, results or effects the new \ncapability should deliver.  \nb. A\nssessment Stage:   This stage develops the URD into a System\nRequirement Document (SRD) which is an output -based statement of what t he\nc\napability must do to meet  the stated requirements in the URD.\nc. D\nemonstration Stage : Contractors develop demonstration/prototype\ncapabilities that they believe meet the URD & SRD.  The outcome of this stage isnormally the selection of a contractor.\nd. M\nanufacture Stage: The agreed solution is delivered to the military\nrequirement within the time and cost agreed. System acceptance is undertaken t o\nens\nure the System satisfies the SRD.\ne. In-S\nervice Stage: This stage is where the military capability is declared as\nbeing available for operational use.\nf. Disposal Stage: The final stage is disposal where the plans for the efficient,\neffective and safe disposal of the capability/equipment are put into effect.\nC\napability Planning and Analysis \n7.4. The Defence Operating Model . The Defence Operating Model describes the core \nactivities undertaken by a M inistry of D efence (MOD) . These activities deliver three outputs: \nDefence Policy, Military Capability and Military Operations.  \nFUNCTIONSGOVERNMENTENABLEPOLICY\nSTRATEGY\nCorporate\nPLANNING\nCorporate\nGOVERNANCEOP ERATEDefence Output\nMILITARY CAPABILITY\nDefence Output\nMILITARY OPERATIONSDefence Output\nDEFENCE POLICYGENERATE military capability\nFigure 7.2   The Defence Operating Model  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 3 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 \n • The Policy, Strategy, Planning and Governance activities are led at the \nDefence- level by the MOD.   \n• Generate is shorthand for generate today’s Military Capability and work with the \nMOD  to develop future capability. Under MOD  direction, it is the responsibility \nof the Military Commands.  \n• Enable describes the support and specialist services provided by the Enabling \nOrganisations in areas such as HR, procurement of military equipment and the \nmanagement of infrastructure.  \n• Operate is about conducting Military Operations when required by Ministers.  \n• Functions these are key act ivities that nee d to be carried out in a coherent way \nacross defence. They cover such defence- wide activities as  finance , health, \ninfrastructure , intelligence, people, etc.   \n7.5. Policy.  National Security Policy sets out what government ministries , who have \nsecurity responsibilities , must do now and in the future  to achieve the government’s security \nobjectives. In response to national security policy , MODs  generate Defence Policy. This  \nstates what defence specifically  needs to achieve.  Together these policies are the Ends.   \n7.6. Defence Strategy .  Defence Strategy is the MOD activity that involves setting and \nprioritising objectives, identifying,  and assessing different ways to achieve them and deciding \non the best way forward – these are the Ways.  These objectives are derived from Defence \nPolicy that has been agreed under the National Security Policy. Defence Strategy comprises \nof Defence Tasks and Defence Planning Assumptions. For example, the United Kingdom \nhas 25 Defence Tasks which describe all the activities which the UK MOD may employ \nmilitary capability on now and in the future – these are made public . Defence Planning \nAssumptions explain what levels of military capability are agreed for each military task, where in the world these tasks may take place, against what sort of enemy, working alongside which allies. It also details how many of the tasks can be done at the same time. \nThis level of detail is normally classified.   \n7.7. Defence Plan . The Defence Plan directs the work of the whole of the MOD  and is \nstructured around the Defence Tasks set out in the Defence Strategy.  As a sub -set of the \nstrategy, a plan is also Ways of applying Means. It is an annual plan which direct s the \nvarious commands  to deliver outputs to meet the overall strategy. The plan allocates \nappropriate resources to deliver these outputs through the budget process. The various \nCommands within defence write their own C ommand plans to meet the defence plan.  \n7.8. Policy, Strategy, Plans Linkage. There is a clear linkage between policy, strategy,  \nand plans. Policy is the highest -level direction on what is to be achieved. Policy directs \nstrategy  – whatever way forward is decided upon to meet strategic objectives, these must be \naligned to policy.  Plans  are developed by the MOD  to direct its activities and by commands  \ntake this direction and create their own plans . All plans  must be written to support the \nstrategy . Governance is the process which ensures that outputs directed in the Defence Plan \nare achieved and remain aligned to Defence Strategy and eventually policy.  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 7.\n9. Capability.  Capability is \ndelivered by Force Elements \ncombined into packages by Joint \nForce Commanders and tailored \nfor specific operations or \nmissions.  Force elements are \ntypically ships, aircraft  (ships and \naircraft are systems and not individual equipment ), army \nformations, other military units, or force enablers. Each force element is delivered by the \ncommands within Defence, \nwhether they be single service or joint.  \n7.10.  Force Elements .  Force Elements are expressed as either Force Elements at \nReadiness – FE@R or Force Elements at Sustainability – FE@S.  Force Elements at \nReadiness – FE@R are Force Elements that will be able to deploy, with planned \nperformance levels, within a given notice period. The notice period is the level of Readiness.  \nForce Elements at Sustainability – FE@S - this is the sustainability of Force Elements \nthroughout their assigned mission. \n7.11.  Capability Gap Analysis.  Capability Gap Analysis is a way to identify potential \nfuture capabilities to meet Defence Strategy. A Capability Gap occurs when analysis \nidentifies that there is no capability to meet a defence strategy. Capability Gaps appear \nwhen:  Policy changes – when there is a security review ; Strategy changes – when there are \nnew defence tasks or defence planning assumptions (includes changes to the enemy); or  \nwhen Technology changes . Capability gap analysis is conducted by the Users who are the \nCommands with an MOD  and follows a process of:  \n• Identify timeframe – which force is capability operating with – When + Who.\n• Which operating environment the capability will be operating in – Where.\n• Which Tasks and Defence Planning assumptions :\no What tasks,\no How long - duration,\no with Who – joint\n?\no wit\nh Whom – allies  and\no Thr\neat.\n7.12.  Military Capability Requirements. A military capability requirement is a measurable \nand enduring description of the things that Defence needs to be able to do.  The Users write \nrequirements  – who are mostly the Commands within the MOD. Users bring with them the \n‘Way we fight’ plus Lessons Identified.  Requirements are written in a specific way  to \ndescribe what is needed rather tha n provide a solution. Requirements are written:  \n• The User shall be able to …\n• The User requires the ability to …….  Figure 7.3   The Military Capability  Model  \n\nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 R\nequirements should endeavour  to be written using the SMART methodology:  \n• Specific: Precise and stated in terms of result to be achieved .\n• Measurable: Easy to determine if result has been met .\n• Achievable: High standards but attainable .\n• Realistic: Aligned to performance needs .\n• Timely: Specified time frame for completion .\nCapability Design and Delivery  \n7.13.  The design and delivery of a capability  will always be a compromise between what \nyou need, how soon you  can get it and what you can afford.  Finding an acceptable balance \nbetween these, often competing, elements will usually  mean trade -offs/cost cutting  and \ntherefore knowing what the key aspects of  your capability  are vital to preserving the core of \nthe capability.     \n7.\n14. Procurement Options.   There are a number of procurement options  open to \nDefence:  \n• Develop with industry required bespoke Equipment .\n• Commercial Off the Shelf  (COTS) .\n• Modified Off the Shelf  (MOTS).\n• Buy Second Hand .\n• Gifting .\n• Defence can buy or lease a capability  with a variety of contracts with industry :\no Contract against a detailed Specification (I want one of these)\no Contract against an outline specification  (I want something that does this)Figure 7. 4   The \nCapability \nCompromise Trinity  SPEED\nQUALITY\n& SCOPECOST\nLow  \nQuality  \nImpossible  \nEXPENSIVE  \n SLOW  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 o Cont\nract for Availability  (I want this number at this time)\no Contract for Capability  (I want the ability to….)  \no Contract for Outcome  (I want these results)\n7.15.  Defence Lines of \nDevelopment .  When \nputting in place a capability \nDefe nce will use the \nDefence Lines of Development template as a \nway to ensure all the elements that make up a capability are covered when \nbuilding it. Also see SOHB 4 -07-01. \nG\nenerating Capability \n7.16.  The generation of Capability is about getting WHAT  you need, WHEN you want it,  \nWHERE  you want it and for  HOW  LONG  you want it  in place for. Having a force always \nready for anything is both unaffordable and probably unachievable.  The cost of having a unit at high readiness will be balanced against risk (Impact and likelihood) together with the likely \nwarning time of any potential threat or deployment situation. \n7.17.  Readiness.  The term “Readiness” is \nused to describe the means by which \nDefence holds its military forces at varying levels of preparedness to respond to emerging threats or operations.  The \nreadiness categories of 1 to 11 are used by \nthe UK military and are shown in Figure 7.6 .  \nThey equate to the time a unit has to be ready to deploy on operations appropriately manned, equipped, trained,  and supported \nto meet the defined requirements and standards set out in the Defence requirements.   Having Force Elements at a \nform of readiness i s known as FE@R . \n7.18.  Assessment and Reporting \nReadiness.  An effective system of assessing and reporting this readiness is an essential element of a credible system.  In the table 7.6  below  3 assessments of units and formations \nare considered:  Figure 7. 5   Defines Lines of Development : \nTEPID OIL  \nFigure 7. 6   UK Force Readiness  \n\nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n1–02–07 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • The \nfirst (B1)\nmeasures t he\npos\nition of Force\nElements in\nrelation to theirpeacetimereadiness states .\n• The sec\nond\nme\nasure (B2 )\npr\novides an\nassessment ofthe ability ofthose Force Elements t\no\nac\ntually get themselves ready to deploy on operations once ordered to do so.\n• The final measure (B3) looks at the ability to actually deploy to theatre and\nconduct and sustain operations.\n7.19.  Sustainability .  The second element of Readiness is sustainability .  Deploying a \nforce quickly is one thing , having the ability to keep it in the fight is another. Having Force \nElements who are sustainable in a future deployment is known as FE@S .  There are 2 \nelements  to FE@S: \n• How much materiel is needed to sustain the force on the operation for t he\ndur\nation required?  This is a combination of the Daily consumption Rate a nd\nt\nhe forecast duration of the potential task.\n• How much of this materiel needs to be on the shelf for a force at a certai n\nReadi\nness ? This is a combination of the capacity of industry to provide th e\nr\nequired material over the warning time a force has  prior to  deploy ment .\nFigure 7.8 below illustrate s how FE@ S may well be a combination of ‘ Just in C ase’ stock on \nthe shelf and Just in Time stock purchased during the warning time. Less Warning time more \n“Just in Case” stock required.   \nThr\nough Life Support  \n7.20.  There are 3 key guiding principles when looking at supporting capability . These are : \nFigure 7. 7   Readiness Assessment\nFigure 7. 8   \nCalculating FE@S  \nSERIAL 1 -02-07 \n• Think\n Whole Life - Support represents the greater part of the whole life cost\n• Be aware that The Support costs are ‘baked in’ early in the CADMID cycle with\n70% cost determined before they start making it.\n• The Aim of “capability support ” sits in the area of capability generation. It aims\nto produce Operational Availability: through the life of the capability: at Value\nfor money for Defence .\n7.21.  Supportability Analysis .  A Supportability analysis hopes to influence the Design \nitself as well as identifying the “S upport ” cost drivers, issues, and requirements. The output \nis the creation of a support plan for the capability.  There are 3 key stages to the analysis:  \n• Design for Support – making sure the design of the capability has support\nfeatures factored in from the outset.\n• Design the Support – Designing the key elements of the maintenance concepts\nthat will provide the expected availability at value for money for Defence.\n• Support the Design – this is a deep analysis into all the support that is needed\nby the various elements for the overall operation and integration of the system.\nFigure 7. 9   Supportability Analysis  \n7.22. Availability.   Defence must be clear on what availability it wants/ gets from a \ncapability and test  and assess  before it buy s. It needs to l ook a t what p revents t he capability \nfrom bei ng available – its \nreliability,  maintainability \nand supportability - and \nfeature these  when \nlooking at the numbers it \nneeds to buy and the \nsupport packa ge it need s \nto put i n place.

Role of the HQ and Organisation of the Staff .  The HQ is a secure base for the \ncommander and the staff, which includes the Joint Operations Centre  (JOC ) and the \nadministrative  and security organisations that protect, sustain and move the commander and \nthe staff.   The role of any HQ is to:  \n•P\nlan operations in support of the Commander’s Intent;\n•Execute control of operations;\n•Provide Situational Awareness and SME advice to the commander so that he can\ncommand operations.\nIn order to deliver its functions with the flexibility to adjust to the operational need, HQs are \nmodular and will have a number of configurations.  eg MAIN HQ, FWD HQ  or ADV HQ .  The \nlocation is a command decision.  HQs can be located on land, afloat, inside or outside the JOA.   \n1.2. Functional Groupings.  All HQ s have three main groupings  of people: \n•C\nommand Group ; the Commander, his personnel staff and principle advisors.\n•Staff  Group; consisting of  staff branches  1-9, as shown below  in figure 1.1, who c an\nbe t\nask organised to provide further functional groups, such as the Principal Planni ng\nG\nroup (PPG) and the Staff Joint Force Planning Group (J FPG) that also exist for the\nplanning cycle - roles for these planning groups are explained in part 3.  Additional\nfunctional groupings may be created for specific tasks, as they are required.\n•Command Support Element ; this provides Communications and Informati on\nS\nystems (CIS), as well as expeditionary life support and force protection for t he\nheadquar\nters.\n1.3.

Chief of Staff .  A Chief of Staff (COS) is responsible for operations, operations \nsupport, plans and intelligence. He coordinates work across the headquarters, with particular \nresponsibility for information management. He is pivotal to the efficient running of the \nheadquarters; a good COS can engender and sustain mutual trust and understanding \nbetween individual staff members, advisers and subordinate headquarters.  \n2.2. Deputy Chief of Staff .  A Deputy COS (DCOS) coordinates logistics, personnel and \noften finance. Though normally of equivalent rank, the COS is primus inter pares. \n2.3. Policy Adviser . The Policy Adviser (POLAD) advises a JTFC on the international, \nregional and local political context, as well as UK Government policy.  \n2.4. Legal  Adviser .  A Legal Adviser (LEGAD) provides legal advice and is pivotal to all \naspects of planning and execution. Targeting and rules of engagement, for instance, will \ndemand his close scrutiny and input.  \n2.\n5. STRATCOM - Media Adviser . A media adviser brings technical and cultural \nunderstanding of media processes and agendas. This shapes not only direct media \nengagement, but also wider activity, through better understanding of how events are likely to \nbe reported and perceived.  \n2.6. Scientific Advisers.  Scientific Advisers (SCIADs), when embedded, provide \noperational analysis support to planning, execution and assessment.  \n2.7. Subject Matter Experts.  A JTFC may employ subject matter experts to advise on \nlocal or regional issues. They may, for example, be indigenous or foreign academics who provide guidance on culture, economy and religion.  \n2.8. Interpreter or Translator Support .  Skilled and experienced interpreters or \ntranslators enhance a JTFHQ considerably. However, locally employed civilians, while readily available, may not always be impartial or reliable.  \nFigure  2.1 showing the principal Staff Officers & Advisors  \nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 1 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 JTFHQ GENERIC STAFF BRANCH & CROSS FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES  \n3.1. Generic Staff Structures .  Most HQs are organised in a generic J1 to J9 structure \nas shown in figure 3.1 along with each branch’s responsibilities.\nFigure 3. 1 Showing  Generic J Staff Branch Responsibilities  \nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 3.2. Cross  Functional Staff Structures .  Figure s 3.2 and 3.3 show how cross functional \nstaff structures integrate members of the J Branch staff to focus on specific requirements \nand support battle rhythm. The cross -functional organization of the staff must facilitate the \nplanning and decision -making processes that are crucial to the JTF HQ .  As a practical \nmatter, the staff should only establish and maintain those cross -functional organizations that \nenhance planning and decision -making within the HQ.  They establish, modify, and dissolve \nthese entities as the needs of the JTF HQ evolve.  \nFigure 3. 2 Cross Functional Staff  Organisations . \n3.3. ACOS of a J - Staff Branch. The role of the Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) of each \ngeneric functional J – Branch is to serve as the principle subject matter expert advisor to the \nCJTF and assist him in the planning, direction and control of operations to achieve his \nmission.  As ACOS he leads, directs and coordinates his overall J function al branch area s of \nresponsibility.  \n3.4. DACOS of a J - Staff Branch.  The role of the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff \n(DACOS) of each generic functional J – Branch is to act as the deputy to the ACOS and act \nin his place if he is absent.   He is responsible to his ACOS for leading any specified areas of \nhis branch.  \nTypes of Cross Functional Staff Organisations  (AJP -3) \n3.5. Centre .  Centres are permanent, cross functional staff integrating organizations. A \ncentre is an enduring functional organization, with supporting staff, designed to perform a \njoint function within the JTF HQ. Often, these organizations have designated locations or  \nfacilities. Examples of centres include the JOC and the joint personnel recovery centre. The \nJOC is the most familiar centre typically found in a joint HQ with dedicated manning and \nfacilities to integrate the activities of the staff for current operations.  The JOC focuses on \nsupporting the direct, monitor, assess, and plan functions for the commander.  \n3.6. Group .  A group is an enduring functional organization formed to support a broad \nfunction within a JTF HQ.  Normally, groups within a JTF HQ include a Joint Force  Planning \n\nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 Group (J FPG) that manages JTF HQ planning.  JFPG functions include leading designated \nplanning efforts, resourcing and managing subordinate planning teams, and coordinating \nplanning activities with other staff directorates.  \n3.7. Cell.  A cell is a subordinate organization formed around a specific process, \ncapability, or activity within a designated larger organization of a JTF HQ.  A cell usually is \npart of both a functional and traditional staff structures.  An example of a cell within the \ntraditional staff structure could be a fire support coordination cell subordinate to the \noperations branch within the J -3.  An example of a cell within a functional staff structure \ncould be a current operations cell within the JOC.  \n3.8. Bureau .  A bureau is a long -standing functional organization, with a supporting staff \ndesigned to perform a specific function or activity within a JTF HQ.  A joint visitors bureau is \nan example of a bureau common to many JTFs.  \n3.9. Office .  An office is an enduring organization that is formed around a specific activity \nwithin a JTF HQ to coordinate and manage support requirements.  An example of an office \nis the joint mortuary affairs office.  \n3.10.  Element .  An element is an organization formed around a specific function within a \ndesignated directorate of a JTF HQ.  The subordinate components of an element usually are \nfunctional cells.  An example of an element is the joint fires element and the joint intelligence \nsupport element.  \n3.11.  Boards .  A board is an organized group of individuals within a JTF HQ, appointed by \nthe commander (or other authority) that meets with the purpose of gaining  guidance or \ndecision.  Its responsibilities and authority are governed by the authority that established the \nboard.  Boards are chaired by a senior leader with members representing major staff \nelements, subordinate commands, liaison officers, and other organizations as required.  Two \ndifferent types of boards are usually formed.  \n• Command Board . A command board is chaired by the commander, and its\npurpose is to gain guidance or decision from the commander.\n• Functional Board . A functional board’s purpose is to gain functionally\nspecific guidance and decisions from the commander (or designated representative)\nbased on a staff recommendation.  These boards often focus on synchronizing a\nparticular function, allocating resources between ongoing or future operations, or\nmaintaining continuity of purpose across ongoing operations.\n3.12.  Working Group . A working group (WG) is a permanent or ad hoc organization within \na JTF HQ formed around a specific function whose purpose is to provide analysis to users. \nThe WG consists of a core functional group and other staff and component representatives.  \n3.13.  Planning  Team. A planning team is a functional element formed within the JTF HQ \nto solve problems related to a specific task or requirement.  Planning teams and WGs are \ncomplementary.  WGs enhance planning through their provision of functional staff estimates \nto multiple planning teams. In contrast, planning teams integrate the functional concepts of \nmultiple functional WGs into plans and orders.  The planning team is not enduring and \ndissolves upon completion of the assigned task.  \nSERIAL 2-01-03 \n2–01-03 – 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025  \nFigure 3. 3 Example of an HQ

Brigades \nsupported by Combat and combat service support units. \nDivisions are grouped within a corps, Joint  Task Force (JTF) or a \ntheatre framework.  Brigades are grouped within divisions.  The \nDivision is resourced to plan and execute simultaneous tactical  \nengagements, whilst at the same time, planning the next set of \ntactical engagements to allow operational tempo to be maintained. \nThe division provides the direction, and sets the conditions for, \nsubordinate brigade activity. This includes the employment or allocation of  forces and assets held at the divisional level.  \nThe KLF Division fights the deep battle, resources the close battle \nand protects the rear  areas:  \n•Fight the Deep Battle . The deep battle is where the divisional\ncommander shapes the battlespace to enable success in t\nhe\nc\nlose battle. The deep battle must be appropriately resourc ed\nand s\nynchronised with the close battle.\n•Resource the Close Battle. The conduct of the close battle is the\nbusiness of the subordinate brigades within the division. Thedivision directs, shapes, enables and sustains brigade activity.\n•P\nrotect the Rear Areas. Operations in the rear area sustain the\ndivision. Physically this includes the protection of lines of\ncommunication forward to the brigades and rearward to the UK\nand its coalition partners. Elements of the rear protection task\nmay be delegated to the logistic brigade.\n1.2  Mech  & \nArmd  \nBdes The brigade provides a potent balance of span of  command, function \nand combat power. As a guide, brigades:  \n•PLAN : Are capable of concurrently planning a tactical acti on\nwh\nilst executing another within a relatively  limited decision/acti on\ncycl\ne.\noIn a complex stabilisation operation, brigade planning may\ninvolve detailed, multi -stakeholder engagement over a\nprotracted timescale.\noIn a dynamic warfighting action, where tempo is key,brigade planning and battle procedure must be mor\ne\nr\napid.  Achieving tempo will require appropriate command\nand control, with an emphasis on rapid planning timelines,\nfragmentary orders (FRAGOs) and the battlefiel d\nc\nirculation of commanders to gauge tactical progress  and\nprovide direction.\n\nSERIAL 2-07- 01 \n2–07– 01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 •EXECUTE :  The Brigade can execute Tactical Activities\n(Offensive, Defensive, Stability and Enabling)  in space that is\ngenerally determined by the range of organic direct fire and\nhabitually aligned combined Arms and Combat Supportcapabilities in close combat (typically around 25 km) –recognizing that factors like population numbers, terrain, mass,intensity and effect have a bearing on space;\n•C2:  Enable through task organization and command the\nmanoeuvre of up to four (five in extremis) Battlegroup points ofcommand.\noExercise command within a defined C3I12envelope,delivered primarily by tactical CIS, including Combat NetRadio (CNR) and this has a bearing on space.\noAre the lowest levels of command where joint and multi -\nnational capabilities  are integrated (recognizing that there\nare exceptions in certain circumstances);\n•SUSTAINMENT :  The brigade must be able to s ustain , as\n a\nya\nrdstick, no more than two tactical engagements thus requiring\nfive days of supply.\n1.3 Tank  \nBattalion Armoured Battalions (3 x Tank Companies of 14 tanks) provide the \nbrigade’s principal protected, precision shock action capability.  The \nbrigade should train to generate flexible groupings of armour, mechanised infantry, fire support and manoeuvre support to meet the \ntactical need.  \n1.4 Mech \nInfantry  \nBattalion Mechanised Infantry Battalions (3 x Mech Companies of 14 APC)  \ncan conduct a range of activities.  They offer high utility in stabilisation \noperations, infantry mass for complex  terrain and  holding ground with  \nthe ability to redeploy forces  for exploitation beyond the contact battle \nwith adequate protection.

Scope.  This serial deals with the topic of command and control and command states \nand supported / supporting relationships . (Source AJP- 01, AJP-3 & AFM Command ). \n1.2. What is Command  & Control ?  Command and control is an institutional and \ncompound term.  It can be a process, a capability, a system or a structure.  It can also be \ntreated as a single whole, 'command and control', with a different meaning to the separate \nwords of 'command' and 'control'. The words ‘command’ and ‘control’ are explained below \nand are exercised through mission command.  (AJP -01) \n1.3. Command Definition : “The authority vested in an individual of the armed forces for \nthe direction , coordination, and control  of military forces. (AAP -06 (2014)).  \n•Direction:  This is defining the objectives to achieve, the actions to take, and theresources and procedures required to achieve those objectives.\n•Coordination.  This is harmonizing and guiding assigned forces to achieve theobjectives.\n•Control :  Control is defined as: ‘the authority exercised by a commander over part of\nthe activities of subordinate organizations, or other organizations not normally undertheir command, encompassing the responsibility for implementing orders or\ndirectives.’ (AAP- 06 (2014)) Control  is to manage and direct forces and functions\nconsistent with a commander’s  command authority\n.\n1.\n4. Principles of J oint & Multinational Command . The following are the principles of \njoint and multinational command.  (AJP- 01 Para 5.4)  \nPrinciple  Note s (abridged)  \nUnity of \nCommand  Unity of command means that all forces operate under one  \ndesignated commander. It requires a single commander  with the \nrequisite authority to direct all forces in pursuit of  the agreed \nobjectives or end state. At the military strategic, operational and \ntactical levels of command, a fundamental  element of C2 is unity \nof command, which provides the  necessary cohesion for the \nplanning and execution of  operations.  \nContinuity of \nCommand  Command should be continuous throughout an operation. During \nan operation, further enhancement of unity of command is desirable through continuity of command. In principle, ‘the \ncommander who plans should execute’; however, circumstances \nmay not permit thi s. \n \nChain of \nCommand  The C2 structure is a hierarchical system and should be defined \nand understood, with all its command responsibilities, by all levels \nof command. A clear chain of  command strengthens integration \nbetween components.  \nIntegration of \nCommand  The command structure should ensure that capabilities are \ndirected decisively  to achieve the operational objectives in the \nmost effective way. Component commands are normally \nenvironmental or functional, but the  specific task organization will \nreflect the higher commander’s  specific operations requirements. \nAn efficient and  comprehensive liaison structure, linking the joint \ntask force  headquarters, all force elements and other \norganisations  is an essential element of the C2 structure.  \nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 2\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.5. Elements of Command.  Command also embraces authority, responsibility and \naccountability. Command has a legal status. It is also vested in a commander by their \nsuperior.   \n•Authority enables an individual to influence events and order subordinates to\nimplement decisions.\n•Responsibility . While commanders can devolve specific authority, they retain overall\nresponsibility for their command – responsibility is thus fundamental to command.\n•Accountability  involves a liability and obligation to answer for properly usi ng\ndel\negated responsibility, authority and resources; it includes the duty to act.  Thus,  a\nc\nommander who delegates responsibility should grant sufficient authority t o\ns\nubordinates to enable them to carry out their task.  Subordinates remai n\nac\ncountable to their superior for executing assigned tasks.\n1.6. Exercising Command:  Military command at all levels is the art of decision making, \nmotivating and directing forces into action to accomplish missions.  It is founded on \nunderstanding and constant assessment of the operating environment and its various actors \nand audiences, people, resources, risk and desired outcomes.  A commander determines \ncourses of action to be taken, leads the force and controls the execution of the mission.   \n1.7. Functions of Command.  The three functions of \ncommand, which are inter -dependent, are decision-\nmaking, leadership and control.  See Fig 1.1.  \n1.8. Command Support .  The following elements are \nrequired to support a commander:  \n•A Staff.\n•Provision of an HQ.\n•Communications and Information Systems.\n•Staff processes and procedures.\n1.9. Commander  & Staff :  A command system \ncomprises not only the commander, but also the staff \nwho, depending on the level of command, contribute to \nthe effect of all three functions, with particular emphasis on control.  Deficiencies in any of the constituents of \ncommand have a detrimental effect on a force’s fighting \npower as a whole.  Commanders should always be prepared to make use of the ideas and \nobjections of others.  Good ideas are not the sole preserve of senior ranks.  \n1.10.  Mission Command .  The philosophy of mission command is covered in \nSOHB Serial 1-02-01. \n1.11.  Commanding  in a Multinational Environment : \n•Operating multinationally, either as part of a formal alliance or an ad hoc coaliti on\ni\nntroduces many challenges for both the multinational JFC and contributing nations’\nnational contingent commanders.\n•A multinational force commander requires political acumen, patience and tact.\n•A force commander should appreciate the linguistic and cultural challenges of\nmultinational operations, recognising that it is their responsibility to communicate wit h\nal\nl subordinates including those for whom English is not the first language.\n•JFCs must understand the national political sensitivities of each of their contingents;\nany anticipated points of difference should be resolved early .\n1.12.  Commanders  and the Media .  The media has become so important in maintaining \npublic and political support that a commander cannot disconnect themselves from it, nor \nshould they allow it to be the sole focus of their efforts.

Command States  and Relationships.  A common understanding of the degrees of \nauthority is a prerequisite for effective cooperation. The following definitions form the basis \nfor this common understanding within NATO under the authority of AJP -1(F) Ver 1 .  The \ndescriptions which follow enable a full understanding of the revised C2 terminology.  \n•Command arrangements must always be qualified by the DTG at which they begin.\n•They should also specify the DTG at which they are likely to end and  must\nac\ncommodate the situation prior to and after transfer of authority (TOA).\n•Note that when working in a multinational environment, the authority grant ed\nt\nhrough command states must be clarified with the issuing commander.\n•While commanders may delegate their authority, they always retain responsibility.\n1.14.  Full Command (FULLCOM) . “The military authority and responsibility of a \ncommander to issue orders to subordinates .”  \n•Notes: Full command covers every aspect of military operations and administration\nand exists only within national services.\n•The term “command” as used internationally, implies a lesser  degree of authority\nthan when it is used in a purely national sense.\n•NATO and coalition commanders do not have full command  over their forces\nassigned to them since nations will delegate only  operational command or\noperational control.\n1.15.  Operational Command (OPCOM).  “The authority granted to a commander to \nassign missions or tasks to subordinate commanders, to deploy units, to reassign forces, and to retain or delegate operational and/or tactical command and/ or tactical control, as the commander deems necessary .”  \n•Note: Operational command does not include responsibility for  administration.\nSer Authority  FULLCOM OPCO M OPCON  TACO M TACON  \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) \n1 Task Organise  the assigned \nelement  X X \n2 Assign  mission s to the assigned \nelement (1) X X X \n(Limited)  \n3 Assign tasks to the assigned element \nfor the purpose of which it has been \nassigned  X X X X \n(Limited)  \n4 May further delegate command authority\n OPCOM  \nOPCON  \nTACOM  \nTACON  OPCOM  \nOPCON  \nTACOM  \nTACON  OPCON  \nTACOM  \nTACON  TACOM  \nTACON  TACON  \n5 Coordinate movement, local defence  \nand force protection.

AAP- 6 does not define a task. Within the context of command states, tasks are \nundertaken within (and are subordinate to) the subordinate force element’s mission. Tasks are \nusually limited by function, time or location.   \n1.16.  Figure 1.2. Abridged Arabic explanation of command & control states & relationships \nbelow Full Command. \n1.\n17. Operational Control (OPCON) .  “The authority delegated to a commander to direct \nassigned forces to accomplish specific missions or tasks that are usually limited by function, \ntime, or location; to deploy units concerned, and to retain or assign tactical command or \ncontrol of those units. ”  \n•Notes: Operational control does not include authority to assign separate\nemployment of components of the units concerned and does not incl ude\nadm\ninistrative or logistic control.\n•For forces allocated under OPCON the gaining commander may not break up t he\nor\nganizational integrity of the force for separate employment.  Under OPCON forces\nassigned may only be employed within certain constraints such as function, time orlocation imposed by the higher authority.\n•For example, the forces may only  be assigned for a single phase of a particular\noperation.  This may be done for national purposes in the case of a multinational\ncontext, where it is in a participating nation’s interest to constrain in some fashi\non\nt\nhe employment of the contributed force.\n•Under OPCON the gaining commander may assign a mission to the assig ned\nel\nement that is distinct from, but related to, the gaining commander’s overall\nmission.\n1.18.  Tactical Command (TACOM) .  “The authority delegated to a commander to assign \ntasks to forces under their command for the accomplishment of the mission assigned by \nhigher authority, and to retain or delegate tactical control of units.”  \n•Note : Under TACOM the gaining commander may only allocate to the assi gned\nf\norce a specific task consistent for the accomplishment of the mission and purpose\nassigned by the higher commander, that is, within the parameters of the current\nmission given by the higher authority.\n•TACOM is used where the superior commander recognizes the need for additionalresources for a task but requires the resources intact for a later role.\n•Under TACOM the assigned force is allocated for specific tasks and is allocat\ned\nnor\nmally for a limited period of time.  This prevents the gaining commander from\nemploying the assigned force in a role or manner not intended by the higher\n\nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 5\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 commander.  When the task is complete, or the specific timeframe expires, the \nTACOM relationship with the gaining force ends.   \n•TACOM is usually applied to specific situations and to elements that have uni que\nc\napabilities.\n1.19.  Tactical Control (TACON) .  “The detailed and, usually, local direction and control of \nmovements or manoeuvres necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned.”   \n•Note s: TACON is generally used to indicate those units that will be located withi n\nanot\nher unit or formation’s assigned geographical boundaries, and by so assigning,\nthe gaining unit becomes responsible for coordination aspects within the shar ed\nar\nea of operations.\n•The gaining commander has authority to coordinate local defence, force protecti on\nand t\nerrain allocation.\n1.20.  Control and Coordination Terms. The following terms may be ascribed \nindependently to  operational and tactical C2 states to delegate elements of authority.  \n1.21.  Administrative Control (ADCON) .  “Direction or exercise of authority over \nsubordinate or other organizations in respect to administrative matters such as personnel \nmanagement, supply, services, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizat ions. ”  \n•Note: No NATO or coalition commander has administrative control over the forces\nassigned to them since, in assigning forces to NATO, nations will delegate only\noperational command or control.\n1.22.  Logistic control (LOGCON) .  “The authority granted to a (NATO) Commander over \nassigned logistics units and organisations in the joint operations area, including national \nsupport elements, that empowers them to synchronize, prioritize, and integrate their logistics functions and activities to accomplish the joint theatre mission.” \n•Note: It does not confer authority over nationally owned resources held by\n a\nnat\nional support element, except as agreed in the transfer of authority or in\naccordance with (NATO) principles and policies for logistics\n1.23.  Coordinating Authority (CA) or DIRLAUTH (Direct Liaison Authority)  \nCoordinating authority is the authority granted to a commander or other individual with assigned responsibility to coordinate specific functions or activities of two or more forces, \ncommands, services or organizations.  The commander or individual has the authority to \nrequire consultation between the organizations involved or their representatives but does not \nhave the authority to compel agreement.  In case of disagreement between the \norganizations involved, the commander or  individual should attempt to obtain essential \nagreement by discussion.  In the event they are unable to obtain essential agreement they \nshall refer the matter to the appropriate authority . \n1.24.  DIRLAUTH. Although AJP- 3(C) uses DIRLAUTH synonymously with CA, UK usage \nmeans  ‘direct liaison authorized’.  Clearly there is potential for confusion, especially when \noperating with MN partners. AAP -6 does not recognise the term DIRLAUTH . \n1.25.  Understanding C2 Authority . The following examples explain the status of \nassigned forces:  \nCan I break up force elements and \ndirect the separate employment of \ntheir component parts?  Only OPCOM authorises the commander to split force \nelements and use component parts separately.  \nCan I use force elements for any \npurpose (give them missions)? Only OPCOM authorises the commander to assign \nmissions to force elements. OPCON authorises the \ncommander to assign missions or tasks for the \nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 6\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 accomplishment of the mission assigned by higher \nauthority.  \nCan I give force elements tasks in \naccordance with their mission?  TACOM allows tasks to be issued to subordinates within \nthe mission given to them by their OPCOM or OPCON \ncommander.  \nCan I delegate control to other \nforce elements (is the relationship \nOP or TAC)?  Only OP command states (OPCOM and OPCON) can \nauthorise delegation of control to another force element.  \nS\nupported/Supporting Relationships  \n1.26.  Overview .  The execution of military operations will often be guided by the \nsupported/supporting relationship when one command, force or unit should aid, protect, \ncomplement or sustain another. This key relationship provides the establishing authority with \nan effective means of weighting the phases and sub- phases of operations with a subordinate \ncommander typically receiving support from, and providing support to, other commanders. \nThe supported/supporting relationship allows the strengths and capabilities of the \nheadquarters and forces of the military command structure to complement each other. \nWithin a force, components or elements can support or be supported for the conduct of a particular activity to create effects.  Subordinate commanders may be supported and act as \nsupporting commanders concurrently. The supported/supporting relationship must work both \nways. The supported commander must be able to participate and comment on developing \nsupport plans of supporting commanders. A complete understanding of the supported \ncommander’s mission, assigned objectives, force capabilities and intent is critical to enable \nthe supporting commander to meet their responsibilities flexibly.  \n1.27.  General Guidance .  A supported commander may be designated for the entire \noperation, a specific phase of an operation, a particular function, or a combination of phases, stages, events and functions  (ie Line of operation, Decisive Condition (DC) or Ope rational \nEffect (OE) or Joint Action ).  \n1.28.  Authority of s upported commander .  Unless limited by Joint Coordination Order or \nFRAGO , the supported commander has the authority for the general direction of the \ndesignated task.  General direction includes the designation and prioritization of targets or \nobjectives, timing and duration of the supporting action, and other instructions necessary for \ncoordination and efficiency.  The JTFHQ  is responsible for ensuring that the supported and \nsupporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander is granted.  \n1.29.  Supported commander .  A supported component commander ‘has primary \nresponsibility for all aspects of a task assigned by higher authority’ and details the support \nrequired from the supporting component commanders, through the JTFC.  \n1.30.  The supporting commander .  A supporting component commander advises the \nsupported component commander on the optimum employment of his assets then delivers \ncapability or support to him, prioritising tasks as required. The supporting component commander may develop a discrete supporting plan but will invariably direct the specific \nactivities of his component elements .  When the supporting commander cannot fulfil the \nneeds of the supported commander, the JTFHQ  will be notified by either the supported or \nsupporting commander. The JTFHQ  is responsible for determining a solution and assigning \npriorities . \nSERIAL 4-01-01 \n4-01-01 - 7\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.31.

Optimum coordination between t he Joint Task Force and all \ncomponent commands is only achieved when each component command knows the \nintentions and capabilities of the other components and also understands the impact of its \nactions on them.  This is enabled through establishing liaison and communications networks. \n2.2. Component Representation in the Joint Task Force Headquarters.  Each \ncomponent command will have a senior representative, vested with authority to make \nrecommendations and facilitate decision- making at the main joint operations planning group \nand joint coordination board.  At the working level, component commands may also need \nspecialists to represent their interests at the various sub- boards, meetings and other \ncoordination mechanisms that make up the staff processes.  When a component command \nis collocate d with JTF HQ, this remit may be reduced.  However, the joint forces maritime \ncommand, the ACC and special operations component command will almost certainly require empowered high quality liaison officers permanently placed within the JTF HQ.  \n2.3. Liaison Officer s’ Role and Tasks.   \n2.\n4. Liaison between Components. In addition to the liaison link up to the JTF HQ, \nliaison between component commands is vital.  Inter-component coordination and liaison \nstaff teams act as the principal method of coordination in ensuring critical information is \nassessed and disseminated throughout the chain of command.  They also have an essential \nrole to play in their host component’s plans and execution, particularly regarding the synchronization of overall component activity.  While liaison teams should be integrated into \ntheir host HQ structure, they are nonetheless responsible to their parent component command.  The requirement for liaison officers is likely to require large numbers of \nindividuals and can be partially offset by CIS.  \n\nSERIAL 4-01-02 \n4–01–02 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Donor \nComponent  Recipient Component  \nMaritime (M)  Land(L)  Air (A) Special \nForces (SF)  Logistics \n(Log)  \nMaritime  MLE(L) MLE(A) (As Req)  (As Req)  \nLand  LLE(M) LLE(A) (As Req)  (As Req)  \nAir ALE(M)  ALE(L)  ALE(SF)  ALE(Log)  \nSF (As Req)  SF(LO)  SOLE  NA \nLog (As Req)  (As Req)  (As Req)  (As Req)  \nTable  1:  of Liaison between Components - Key: ALE: Air Liaison Element; LLE: Land Liaison \nElement ; LO: Liaison Officer; MLE: Maritime Liaison Element.  \nAir Component Liaison  with JTFHQ .  \n2.5.

What  are Rules of Engagement ?  Rules of E ngagement (ROE) are the \nauthorisation for, or limits on, the use of force during military operations.  While ROE  must be \nlawful, they are a statement of policy that provides political direc tion for the conduct of \nmilitary operations, inc luding authorisations for, and lim itations on, the threat or  use of force \nor actions which might be construed as provocative.  ROE do not lim it the inherent right of \nself-defence in any  situation. \n3.2. How are ROE written?  Formulation of ROE is influenced by a variety of factors.  \nROE first must be lawful.  International law defines the lawful limits for the use of force \nduring military operations.  National law may further limit the use of force in certain types of \nmilitary  operations or in certain situations.  Within this legal framework, the key element is \nthe political and senior military policy input into the ROE profile.   \n3.3. ROE to Control Behaviour.  In periods of tension, prior to armed conflict reasonable \nand prudent effort should be made to control a situation without the use of forc e.  When time \nand conditions permit, the potentially hostile forc es should be warned and given the \nopportunity  to withdraw or cease threatening actions, and further warned that forces will take \naction, as necessary.  With respect to mission accomplishment, the degree of force used \nmust be no more than that necessary to carry  out duties  and accomplish assigned objectives \nof the mission.  Force used must be limited to the degree, intensity, and duration nec essary \nto achieve the objectiv e.  Miscalculations can mak e the situation worse.    \n3.4. ROE in Armed conflict.  Following c ommencement of armed conflict, the law of \narmed conflict applies.  Commanders will continue to use the policies and procedures to \nauthorise and implement required ROE after a commencement of armed conflic t.  In such \ncases, ROE generally limit or restrict the otherwise lawful use of forc e in accordance with \nlaw of armed conflic t.  ROE requested and authorised must not unduly restrict, beyond the \nrestrictions imposed by international law, the commander’s ability to effectively carry out the \nmission and obtain Military Advantage.   \n3.5. Political Policy Statement (PPS) and Political Policy Indicators (PPI).  With each \nROE profile is a PPS.  This gives succinct narrative guidance on its political policy to enable \ncommanders  to respond appropriately as a situation develops.  The PPS will be explained in \nplain language and reflect the overall policy aim to frame the authorised ROE in the proper \ncontext for the mis sion. The PPS may change as mission objectives and ROE authorisations \nmature to reflect changes in polic y. The PPS will be complemented by Political Policy \nIndicators (PPls) which clarify the trends regarding the fores eeable or expected development \nof the situation. These PPls are divided into 3 categories  X, Y and Z according to the \nfollowing criteria: \na. XRAY  - De-escalation.  Political/military strategy is to minimize involvement in\nthe crisis to that necessary to achieve the aim.\nb. YANKEE  - Maintain status quo .  Political/military strategy is to use forces to\nmaintain current regional balance or return to previous status quo following\ndestabilisation. Significant use of force to support specific objectives may be\nauthorised under PPI Yankee.\nc. ZULU  - Risk of Escalation is Acceptable .  Political/military strategy is to\nauthorise the use of force to support achievement of the grand strategy includingchange of the status quo ante to generate a more favourable environment. Implicit inthe approval of PPI ZULU is political recognition that military action may lead to\nescalation of the crisis.\nSERIAL 4-01-03 \n4–01–03 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 3.6. ROE Structure .  The ROE are written as a series of prohibitions and permissions \napplicable to activities in a wide range of military operations.  \na. Prohibitions .  When  issued as prohibitions, the rules are orders to commanders\nnot to take the  designated action(s).\nb. Permissions.  When issued as permissions, they define the limits of the threat\nor use of force, or of actions which might be construed as provocative, that\ncommanders may take to accomplish their mission.\nc. Unusual Circumstances.   The ROE  document is, however, only  drawn from a\nm\nenu of possible options.  The specific circumstances of each operation may require\nthat nations or commanders propose for approval ROE not listed in the normal\ndocument.\n3.7. Requesting, Authorising & Implementing ROE .  Based on the OPLAN, the \nmission and tasks, and the development of the situation, the Joint commander will consider \nthe appropriate ROE to be implemented in support of mission accomplishment.  There are 3 \nparts to the process:  \na. ROE Request Message (ROEREQ) .  Sent by requesting HQ up the chain of\ncommand to ask for ROE or change existing ROE.\nb. ROE Authorisation message (ROEAUTH) .  Sent by the strategic ( or ROE\nAuthorising) HQ to the Joint Task Force Commander with its decision.\nc. ROE Implementation message (ROEIMPL) .  Issued by the Joint Task Forc e\nC\nommander to the JTFHQ and components implementing the authorised ROE.\n3.8. Detailed Procedures .  Detailed procedures to amplify ROE guidance may be \nrequired to be promulgated by force or formation commanders for the following actions and \noperations which could lead to the use of force:  \na. Challenging procedures.\nb. Issuing warnings.\nc. Use of warning shots.\nd. The conduct of demolition operations.\ne. The conduct of cordon and/or search operations.\nf. The operation of check points.\ng. The designation and operation of secure areas.\nh. Weapons release authority.\ni. Other operations as may be required by the local situation.\nUse of deadly force in support of civil law enforcement functions is a particularly sensitive issue and in preparing the ROE all force options should be considered.  \n3.9. Dormant ROE .  Dormant ROE allow the chain of command to plan, prepare orders, \ntraining and materiel to be used once the dormant ROE become operative.  Dormant ROE are approved by the authorising HQ, but only  become operative at a particular milestone  or \nset of circumstances.  Such ROE are useful in rapidly evolving operational circumstances and authority for release of the ROE can be delegated to the appropriate level (ie component \ncommander) for rapid response to events.  When this happens, the chain of co mmand must \nbe informed immediately.  \nSERIAL 4-01-03 \n4–01–03 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 3.10.  Example Rule of Engagement .

International law principally governs relations between \nstates.  It is sometimes known as public international law or the law of nations.  \n4.2. Scope of International Law .  International law governs international relations both \nin time of peace and in time of armed conflict.  It covers, for example, the delimitation of \ninternational boundaries, international trade, the law of the sea, air and space law, human \nrights, protection of the environment, and diplomatic relations.  It also regulates the \ncircumstances in which states may use armed force (traditionally termed ‘jus ad bellum’) and \nthe way in which armed force is actually used (traditionally termed ‘jus in bello’ or ‘the law of \nwar’). \n4.3. War or Armed conflict ?  The term ‘armed conflict’, rather than ‘war’, is preferred \ntoday because it is wider in scope than the term ‘war’ which was, and indeed still is, a \ntechnical term with certain legal implications.  The Geneva Conventions refer to ‘cases of \ndeclared war or of any other armed conflict’.   A formal declaration of war is not required to \nbring the law of armed conflict into effect.  It applies whenever there is an armed conflict \nbetween states or a belligerent occupation of all or part of the territory of another state, even if it is not resisted by armed force.  Armed conflict can be defined as:  \n• ‘any difference arising between States and leading to the intervention of\nmembers of the armed forces is an armed conflict’; or\n• ‘an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force betw\neen\nS\ntates or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organis ed\nar\nmed groups within a State’.\n4.4. When does the LOAC Apply?   The law of armed conflict applies from the \nbeginning of an armed conflict until the general close of military operations.  However, in the \ncase of occupied territories, its application continues until the termination of the occupation, \neven if military operations, if any, ceased at an earlier date.   One of the most important \ncharacteristics of the law of armed conflict is its universal application.  It applies with equal \nforce to all parties engaged in an armed conflict, whether or not any party is considered to be \n‘an aggressor’ or ‘a victim of aggression’.  \n4.5. The use of Force  by States.  Charter of the United Nations 1945 (UN Charter), \nArticle 2, para 4, requires  States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or \nuse of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.  There are \nexceptions to this prohibition:  \n• First, the Security Council of the United Nations (UN) may authorize the use of\nforce, under Ch VII of the UN Charter, if it determines that there is in existence a threat\nto the peace, breach of the peace, or an act of aggression.\n• Second, states have the inherent right of individual or collective self -defence if an\narmed attack occurs, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary t o\nm\naintain international peace and security (Art 51 of the UN Charter).  They must\nimmediately report the measures taken to the Security Council.\n4.6. Individual Requirement to Comply with the Law of Armed Conflict  (LOAC) .  \nRegardless of the justification for or the legitimacy of any resort to force, individual members \nof the armed forces must act in accordance with the law of armed conflict. If they fail to do \nso, they will be acting illegally.  \n4.7. Purpose of the LOAC .  The main purpose of the law of armed conflict is to protect \ncombatants and non -combatants from unnecessary suffering and to safeguard the \nfundamental human rights of persons who are not, or are no longer, taking part in the conflict \n(such as prisoners of  war, the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked) and of civilians.  \nSERIAL 4-01- 04 \n4–01– 04 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 4.8. Components of LOAC .  The law of armed conflict was traditionally divided into two \nparts, each  named after the city where much of the law was devised. \n• Hague law  was largely concerned with how military operations are conducted;\n• Geneva law was concerned with the protection of the victims of armed conflict.\nThe two bodies of law have now merged.  However, there is still a distinction  between the \nlaw relating to armed conflicts between states, known as international  armed conflicts, and \narmed conflicts within the territory of a state,  known as internal (or non -international) armed \nconflicts. \n4.9. Sources of LOAC .  The law of armed conflict is to be found in:  \n• Customary Law —rules developed from the practice of states which are bindi ng\non s\ntates generally; and\n• Treaty Law —rules expressly agreed upon by states in international treaties\nwhich are only binding on states party to those treaties.\n4.10.  Neutrality .  The traditional law of neutrality defines the relationship under \ninternational law between states engaged in an armed conflict and those that are not \nparticipating in that conflict.  Traditionally, the law has incorporated the principle of non -\nparticipation in armed conflict and also impartiality in certain dealings with the belligerents.  \n4.11.  Basic Principles of the Law of Armed Conflict .  Four fundamental principles still \nunderlie the law of armed conflict. The law of armed conflict is consistent with the economic \nand efficient use of force.  It is intended to minimize the suffering caused by armed conflict \nrather than impede military efficiency  \n• Military Necessity .  Military necessity permits a state engaged in an arme d\nc\nonflict to use only that degree and kind of force, not otherwise prohibited by the law of\narmed conflict, that is required in order to achieve the legitimate purpose of t he\nc\nonflict, namely the complete or partial submission of the enemy at the earliest\npossible moment with the minimum expenditure of life and resources.\n• Humanity .  Humanity forbids the infliction of suffering, injury, or destruction not\nactually necessary for the accomplishment of legitimate military purposes.• Distinction .  Since military operations are to be conducted only against th\ne\nenem\ny’s armed forces and military objectives, there must be a clear distincti on\nbet\nween the armed forces and civilians, or between combatants and non- combatants,\nand between objects that might legitimately be attacked and those that are protected\nfrom attack.\n• Proportionality .   The principle of proportionality requires that the losses\nresulting from a military action should not be excessive in relation to the expect ed\nm\nilitary advantage.\n4.12.  Combatants and Non -combatants .  The law of armed conflict protects members \nof the civilian population by making a distinction between combatants, who take part in the \nfighting, and non -combatants, who do not take part in the fighting and who must be shielded, \nas far as possible, from its effects. \n• Combatants  have the right to attack and to resist the enemy by all the methods\nnot forbidden by the law of armed conflict.  Combatants are obliged to distinguis h\nt\nhemselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or i n a\nm\nilitary operation preparatory to an attack.\n• Non-combatants, by contrast, are not permitted to take a direct part in hostilities\nand are liable to trial and punishment if they commit, or attempt to commit, hostile acts.\nSERIAL 4 -01-05 \n4-01-05 - 1\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 COMBAT EFFECTIVNESS - LAND  \nReference:  \nA.

UK Divisional Standard Operating Procedures .\nINTRODUCTION  \n5.1 One of the responsibilities of the commander is to consider the implications of  Combat \nEffectiveness on any proposed tactical actions , and on the levels of logistic support necessary to \nmaintain a unit’s or formation’s combat effectiveness (CE).  CE is defined as: ‘The ability of a unit \nor formation, or equipment to perform assigned missions or functions ’. \n5.2 The assessment of CE  should consider  both quantit ative (measurable facts ) and subjective \nqualitative (military judgement) analysis  and may be expressed as a level or percentage . \n• Quantitative Assessment  (Measure) .  Combat Power is a qualitative measure.\nCombat Power is defined as ‘the total means of destructive and/or disruptive force whic h a\nm\nilitary unit/formation can apply against the opponent at a given time’.   This is a\nmeasurement of unit personnel strength, equipment  and logistic status against planni ng\nbas\nelines.\n• Qualitative Assessment\n(Judgement) .  Leadership, unit\npersonnel knowledge, situati on on\nt\nhe ground, training,  and morale.\n5.3 These variables can be \nsummarised in the schematic here  \nusing the fighting power model . \nQuantitative  measurable variables are \nunderlined, qualitative military judgment \nones  are not . \nCATEGORIES OF COMBAT \nEFFECTIVENESS \n5.4 CE reflects the ability of a \nformation to perform assigned missions \nor functions  (in a particular \ntime/space/terrain) , it can  be broken \ndown into categories as follows : \n• Green  (100 – 80% CE ).  The formation/unit  is fully combat effective and has  no\nc\nonstraints on operations in the next 72 hours. There are no recognised problems that\nprevent normal progress either immediately or in the foreseeable future. No actions outside\nof the normal operation procedure are required and no command decision needed.\n• Amber  (60 – 80% CE).  The formation/unit is currently combat effective but there may\nbe some limitations on future operations beyond 48 hours.  In this case the formation must\n\nSERIAL 4 -01-05 \n4-01-05 - 2\nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 explain what the limitations will be and predict how and when the situation is likely to change.  \nThis assessment indicates that there is a problem and that although is not severe enough to \nprevent progress at this time, it is likely to change to RED in the future unless a distinct action or decision is made.  The action may be as simple as monitor closely or continue with \nreduced capability; however, a distinct action or command decision is still required in addition \nto the normal operation procedures. \n• Red (40 – 60% CE).  The formation /unit is only partially combat effective, havi\nng an\ni\nmmediate limitation on operations.  The formation must explain the limitations and forecast\nwhether the situation will improve or deteriorate.  This assessment indicates that there is a\nproblem that is severe enough to prevent normal progress in this particular area.  A distinct\naction or command decision is required to permit positive progress to continue.• Black (less than 40% CE).  The formation/unit  is combat non -effective and should not\nbe used for operations.  The formation should explain the current limitations and the acti\non\nbei\nng taken to improve the situation.  This assessment indicates that there is a problem that\nis severe enough to prevent progress in this particular area and that there is no immediat e\ns\nolution available to rectify the situation.  A distinct action or command decision is required to\neither remove/ignore the particular parameter or to put measures in place that may rectify t he\npar\nameter over a period of time.\n5.5 The commander’s assessment of the combat effectiveness of his formation/unit is based on \nhis personal knowledge of his organisation and may only be partially based on factual information. \nCommanders of subordinate units are responsible to state in their daily reports their assessment of \nthe unit CE. This allows the superior HQ to assess its ability to perform its mission. Whenever the \nstatus of the unit CE changes (moves from one colour to another, in either direction) Commanders \nare to report that situation to the HQ.  The table below summarises the measurement of CE:  \nSer Category  Functional \nStatus  CE \nCapability  Operational \nAssessment Criteria  \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) \n1 GREEN  No/light \ndamage  100 – 80% \nCE Fully \nOperational  Able to carry out the majority \nof functions for which the unit \nwas designed.  \n2 AMBER  Moderate \ndamage  60 – 80% \nCE Largely \nOperational  Able to carry out the basic \nprimary  functions, but with \nsome degradation.  \n3 RED  Severe \nDamage 40 – 60% \nCE Minimal \nOperational  Able to carry out some of the  \nfunctions, but suffering from  \nsignificant degradations  \n4 BLACK  Functionally \ndestroyed  less than \n40% CE  Non-\noperational Unable to carry out any of the \nfunctions for which the unit was originally designed \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 JOINT INTELLIGENCE  \nThis serial is a summary of :  JDP 2 -00 (4th  Edition) dated Aug 2023.  Intelligence, Counter -\nIntelligenc e & Security Support to Joint Operations.  \n1.1. The Relationship between Intelligence & Understanding .  (JDP 2 -00 from Para \n1.8) \n•Understanding  comes from applying judgement to knowledge to gain a deeper level\nof awareness of a situation and implications for the future. Judgement is a purely\nhuman skill, based on experience, expertise and intuition. Understanding,  therefore,\nconcerns acquiring, developing and applying knowledge to prioritise informati on\nr\nequirements, make sense of a given context, make better decisions,  and adapt and\ninfluence behaviours.\n•Intelligence is a Joint Function (See SOHB Serial 1- 02-01) and plays a critical role\nby providing the processed information required to develop understanding. This\nincludes not only answering the main intelligence questions of who, what, where,\nwhen, why and how, which provide the context and narrative of events, but also the\ndeductive and predictive analysis (also known as insight and foresight), whic h\npr\novides the added  value in an assessment.\n1.2. The Aims of Intelligence: (JDP 2 -00 from Para 1.10)  \n•Enable Understanding .  Understanding of the operating environment an d\naudi\nences, including their  intentions, capability and motivation.\n•Provide support to strategy formulation.   By providing support and assessments\nto generate understanding of the operating environment, including adversaries  and\nneut\nral actors’ capabilities and intent.\n•Produce predicive assessments .  These should be forward looking, enabli ng\nc\nommanders to maintain the initiative.\n•P\nrovide indicators & warnings.   Detect and report time -sensitive intelligenc e and\ni\nnformation on developments that could involve or constitute a threat. It includes\nforewarning of actions or intentions.\n•Intelligence monitoring .  This provides an intelligence baseline on countries,\nregions and actors before a crisis arises\n1.3. Princi ples of Intelligence: (JDP 2 -00 from Para 2.2) Intelligence at all levels is \nguided by 8 enduring principles. These should govern the mindset, organisation and \nactivities of those involved.  \n•Command  \n(or decision-\nmaker) led Setting the conditions for effective  intelligence is a fundamental responsibility \nof command. C ommanders must express their critical information and \nintelligence  requirements  and resource the capability.  \n•ObjectivityIntelligence should always be unbiased . Intelligence staff should not distort \nassessments to fit  preconceived ideas or to provide answers that they think \ncommanders or  planners want  \n•PerspectiveAlternative perspectives reinforce objectivity. Even facts  supported by strong \nevidence will be contested by others and understanding somebody’s \nperception can be as important as understanding the facts.  \n•AgilityIntelligence staff should continuously adapt their activities to  the changing \nenvironment and the requirements of their commanders. This  particularly \nimplies mental and organisational agility. Agility is further supported by \nresilience, adaptation and flexibility.  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •TimelinessIntelligence should be delivered in time. It is better to provide  80% of the \nintelligence in time, with appropriate caveats on confidence levels,  than \n100% of the intelligence too late  \n•CollaborationSharing individual understanding to achieve greater  collective and common  \nunderstanding is a powerful tool in joint and coalition operations. The ‘need \nto know’ principle may endure to maintain security,  but a collaborative \nenvironment relies on a ‘duty to share’ culture across and possibly outside \ngovernment, underpinned by pragmatic risk management . \n•ContinuityExperience is gained slowly but can be lost quickly. Some  skills are enduring \nand transferable, particularly in ongoing operations.  Maintaining access to \nsubject matter experts is one way to achieve continuity  of understanding.  \n•SecuritySecurity permeates the entire intelligence enterprise. Security  risks are \nmitigated by technical measures, enforcing rules and procedures,  discipline \n(including self -discipline) and effective counter -intelligence operations . \n1.4. Additional NATO principles .  NATO principes are broadly similar to the UK principles. \nHowever, NATO has the following additions : \n•Interoperability. Common or interoperable processes, networks and systems are\nrequired to support intelligence direction, collection, processing and dissemination.\nThey are also required to manage the intelligence organisation.\n•Sharing/collaboration. Intelligence has the capability to draw on the skills of a wi de\ns\npectrum of experts and specialists in a variety of organisations, across all\ncommands and at all levels of operations. It should be noted that any sharing ofintelligence with foreign authorities must comply with domestic and international law\nand guard against shared intelligence contributing to unacceptable conduct.\n•Accessibility . Relevant information and intelligence must be processed by\nintelligence staff and be readily available to intelligence users. Intelligence is of\n no\nv\nalue if it is not disseminated or accessible to those who require it.\n•Anticipation . Intelligence is as much about warning and forecasting possible futur e\ndev\nelopments for decision- makers as it is about delivering for current circumstances\n1.5. The Levels of Intelligence. (JDP 2 -00 from Para 2.12)  \nStrategic \nIntelligence  Defined as:  ‘intelligence required for the formation of policy, military planning and \nthe provision of indicators and warnings at the national and/or international levels. ’ \nThis is typically gathered in response to government  requirements, focusing on \nnational threats, supra- national issues and conflict drivers. The nature of strategic \nintelligence means that a wide variety of intelligence sources and assets outside \nnational capabilities  are used.  \nOperational \nIntelligence  Defined as:  ‘intelligence required for the planning and conduct of campaigns at the  \noperational level.’  The primary users of this type of intelligence are operational -level \ncommanders and decision- makers with a specific area  of responsibility.  \nTactical \nIntelligence  Defined as: ‘intelligence required for the planning and execution of operations at \nthe tactical level. Tactical intelligence normally supports specific activities by \ntactical -level \ncommanders or units. ’  In most cases, intelligence assets providing tactical  \nintelligence belong to the tactical headquarters involved \nNon-military views of the strategic, operational and tactical . Commanders and intelligence staff \nmust consider that non- military  organisations may have different definitions for strategic, \noperational and tactical levels. This is especially true when working with civilian organisations  and \nlaw enforcement agencies.  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.6. The Limitations of Intelligence  Assessment .  (JDP 2 -00 from Para 2.15) \n•Human judgement . Human beings have limits making exacting analytical\njudgements in complex and rapidly changing environments. This impacts not only\nassessment but also decisions made because of them.  Intelligence may also not\nmeet the commander’s requirements exactly or be entirely accurate, complete or\neasily corroborated, but the commander will have to make judgements and decisions\nbased on it .\n•Audience intentions. It has always been exceptionally difficult to determi ne an\nadv\nersary’s intentions. In the contemporary and future operating environments,\nwhere the size of an adversary’s military capability may be less relevant due to\nunconventional or hybrid tactics, intelligence staff should ensure that commanders\nunderstand the increased difficulty of determining an adversaries’ and other\naudiences’ capabilities and intentions.\n•Extent of available a sset capability . All collection, exploitation and processi ng\nas\nsets have limitations. These limitations may arise from availability, volume and the\nability/capacity to process, exploit or disseminate in a timely manner.  Intelligenc e\ns\ntaff must closely engage with the ISR staff for a realistic appraisal of collection,\nexploitation and processing capability. Information obtained rarely provides  a\nc\nomplete picture and any sources of information must be liable to doubt a nd\naddi\ntional scrutiny.\n•Relevance/obsolescence. All intelligence is time -bound and subject to expiry.\nConstant evaluation and updating of the existing current intelligence, as well as the\nproduction of new intelligence, will preserve relevance of information given to\ncommanders and their staff. The continuous updating of basic intelligence is als o\nnec\nessary.\n•Source protection. Source protection is critical where sensitive or covert collecti on\nc\napabilities are involved. However, source protection should not become a reason for\nwithholding intelligence from those who need to know. The compromise of a sourc e\nc\nould result in the information no longer being available, the source being used to\npass deceptive information or the source being physically harmed or removed. Often,authority for release for information derived from sensitive or covert collecti\non\nc\napabiliti es will be controlled through higher authorities, including potentially at the\nnational level.\n•Management of Expectations . Even when exploited fully, intelligence will not\nproduce complete certainty. Intelligence staff must be realistic about what intelligenc e\nac\ntivity can achieve and they must manage the commander’s expectations whil e\ndoi\nng all they can to optimise available resources. .\n1.7.

Counter -Intelligence.   Counter -intelligence is defined as: those activities \nconcerned with identifying and counteracting the threat to security posed by hostile intelligence services or organisations or by individuals engaged in espionage, sabotage,  \nsubversion or terrorism.   Counter -intelligence is an all -source intelligence function that \nprovides commanders at all levels with a detailed understanding of threats and \nvulnerabilities to enable them to make well -informed decisions on security , intelligence \ndisciplines and activities .  \n1.11.  Generic Intelligence and Information Requirements. Any  HQ Staff must set the \nparameters for their intelligence and information requirement to support operations planning \nand execution ; stating  what they  wants to know and by when.  They  need to discuss:  \n•What do we want to understand and how soon?\n•What do we know?\n•What are the potential gaps in our knowledge?\n•How do we fill those gaps?\n•How do we exploit our knowledge?\n1.12.  Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs) .  Information \nconcerning areas that are either critical to the success of the mission , or represent a \ncritical threat  are expressed as CCIRs.  CCIRs can range across all of the Information \nand intelligence requirement categories above and so are not always just intelligence \nfocused.  The  fewer the CCIRs, the better ; so the staff can focus its efforts and allocate \nscarce resources.  CCIRs are  always : \n•Specified by the commander for each mission or operation.\n•Related to planned decisions.\n•Applicable only to the commander who specifies them.\n•Situation dependent - directly linked to present and future missions.\n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Time sensitive. Answers to CCIRs must be immediately reported to the commander\nby any communications system available.\n•Always included in operational staff work (OSW).\n1.13.  Categories of Inf ormation & Intelligence Requirements . (JDP 2 -00 from Para \n3.7) IRs are sub- divided into categories : \n•Information Re quirements. Information about an adversary or potentially hostile  \nactors and other relevant aspects of the operational environment that needs to be  \ncollected and process ed to meet the intelligence requirements of a c ommander’ \nInformation requirements consist of the following:\noSpecific Information Requirements (SIR). Specific information requirements \ndescribe the information required, the location where the required information \ncan be collected and the time during which they can be collected’.\noEssential Elements of Information (EEI). Commander’s critical information  \nrequirements can be broken down into more manageable ess ential  \ninformation requirements , which clarify points for collection and analys is. They \nare bounded by time and location and provide focused specific questions or \ntasks for collectors.\noRequest for information (RFI). A unit can issue an information requirement \nto another organisation as a request for information when it does not hav e \nsufficient allocated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance resources.  \nA formalised RFI management proc ess manages the flow of RFIs and  \nresponses.\n•Intelligence Re quirements. The portion of the CCIRs that intelligenc e staff will seek  \nto ans wer are referred to as intelligenc e requirements . Intelligence requirements  \narticulate gaps in knowledge that must be filled or levels of understanding that must  \nbe maintained (enduring intelligence requirement) so that a commander can conduct  \nplanning.  Intelligence requirements may be further c ategorised as follows:\noPriority Intelligence Requirements (PIR).  Some intelligence requirements  \nwill be critical to the planning and conduct of operations. These are  \ndesignated priority intelligence requirements. They are those intelligence  \nrequirements for which a commander has a stated priority for planning and  \ndecision-m aking.\noEnduring intelligence requirements.

This is \na continuous process that seeks , with  to inform the  comprehensive understanding of the \noperating environment (CUOE ) and forms the basis for the development of the joint \nintelligence estimate.  It produces a dynamic product that focuses intelligence effort and \ninforms prioritisation of intelligence requirements.   The JIPOE promotes situational \nawareness and highlights future requirements for intelligence and should.   The process is \ndescribed in SOHB Serial 3- 01-05.   \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 JOINT INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE \nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT (JIPOE)  \nArea Evaluation Threat Evaluation Threat Integration \nPhysical Terrain \nAnalysis  Adversary Analysis Adversary aims & \nobjectives  \nA ctor Analysis Adversary COAs \n1.15.

The \nCUOE is a combination of the information environment assessment, the JIPOE and other \nstakeholder analysis/engagement.  \n1.\n16. The (Joint ) Intelligence Estimate .  The outcome of the JIPOE process forms the \nbasis of the joint Joint intelligence estimate.   The principal outputs of the joint intelligence \nestimate are:  \n•An understanding of the operational environment and actors;\n•An assessment of the adversary’s capabilities, intent and opportunities based on t he\nav\nailable intelligence;\n•Identification of the adversary’s probable COAs and the probability of  their adoption;\nFigure 1.1 Comprehensive Understanding of the Operating Environment  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 7 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Providing commanders with the intelligence required for the operational estimate;\n•Proving the start point for intelligence planning by identifying intelligenc e\nr\nequirements; and\n•Highlighting the intelligence- sharing requirements between nations to  support the\noperation.\n1.17.  Intelligence Support to Planning. (JDP 2 -00 from Para 7.1) Intelligence staff \nsupport the joint operational estimate planning process. Intelligence staff must remain \ncognisant of the commander’s requirements as they evolve, so the commander must include \nthe intelligence staff in all aspects of planning.   The sequence of J2 activities  to support \nplanning is: \n•Step 1 – Initiation . Initiation reviews the inputs from the strategic level, higher\nheadquarters and within J2 it initiates the JIPOE. Initiation focuses on conducti ng an\noper\national area evaluation, threat identification and threat area evaluation, and will\nreview the physical terrain and the information environment. Within the threat\nevaluation, the intelligence staff will seek to understand the adversary and conduct\nanalysis of the span of actors within the operational environment. Threat integrati on\nwil\nl seek to identify adversary aims and objectives and will consider potential enemy\nCOAs .\n•Step 2 – Mission Analysis.  The mission analysis stage takes the product from t he\ni\nnitial JIPOE and develops it further  by identifying and analysing the problem through\nthe conduct of the joint intelligence estimate.  Mission analysis will include:\noanalysing the impact of the operational environment;\noidentifying gaps in the deployed intelligence architecture;\noidentifying the specific and implied intelligence tasks;\noreviewing the availability and capabilities of intelligence assets;\nodetermining the commander’s initial critical information requirements;\nodetermining the limitations of intelligence support;\noproposing acceptable risk guidelines;\noconducting a thorough timeline estimate.\n•Step  3 – Course of Action Development .  In addition to supporting the COA teams\nwork the J2 staff will develop the detail of the primary actors’ most likely and most\ndangerous COAs for the staff to plan against.\n•Step 4 – Course of Action Analysis .  Intelligence input to COA development  and\nev\naluation includes the following:\noConducting a review of the situation and environmental characteristics,\nconcentrating on those aspects that have changed since the initial COAs\nwere developed.\noA detailed description, in priority order, of the threats for each COA from most\nlikely to least likely and from most dangerous to least dangerous.\noIntelligence staff support to any wargaming the commander requires.   The\ni\nntelligence staff provide the overall context for the operation and represent\nthe various actors, especially adversaries  in wargaming .\noUpdating understanding through responses to the CCIR and other informati on\nrequi\nrements.\n•Step 5 – Course of Action Validation & Comparison.

The principal intelligenc e\nadv\niser has an important role in helping the commander decide which COA t o\nc\nhoose. Subsequently, a final intelligence assessment is required for the\ncommander’s planning directive  and/or warning order 3 .\n•Step 7 – Plan Development .  The J2 staff will support the propuction of t he\nS\nITUATION section of the OPLAN / or OPORD and finalise the Joint Intelligenc e\nE\ntimate  outputs  that will be issued as Annex  D.  The Appendises  of Annex D include:\n4-02-01 \n4–02–01 - 8 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 o D-1: Area of Intelligence Responsibility and Interest . \no D-2: Counter Intelligence and Security . \no D-3: Collection, Co -ordination and Intelligence Requirements Management \n(CCIRM).  \no D-3 Enclosure1: ICP . \no D-4: Intelligence Support Architecture . \no D-5: Human Intelligence (HUMINT) . \no D-6: Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) . \no D-7: Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) . \no D-8: Intelligence Support to Targeting.  \no D-9: Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR).  \nThe Intelligence Core Functions  and Intelligence Cycle.  (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3.1).  \n1.18.  The Intelligence \nCycle. There are four \noverarching core functions in \nthe intelligence cycle: \ndirection, collection, \nprocessing and \ndissemination (DCPD). \nInformation must be acquired \nfrom all sources available;  it \nmust be properly understood \nand its significance for \ndecision- making assessed. \nAll of this must be conducted based on clear and \nmethodical requirements for \ninformation and the \nsubsequent assessments \nmust be conveyed to those \nwho need them to support \ntheir decision- making. All \nthese activities take place \nconcurrently and  interact \nwith one another, overlap and coincide but, ultimately, they \nare intended to meet information \nrequirements provided by direction. As a result, they are often seen as an intelligence ‘cycle’, \nwith requirements from decision‑ makers giving direction to collection, analysis and \nprocessing with the final product being disseminated to decision- makers to meet those \nrequirements. The intelligence cycle is visualised at Figure 1.1.  \nDirection (Step 1 of Intelligence Cycle)  (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3. 4) \n1.19.  Direction Overview .  Direction within the intelligence cycle is defined as: the \ndetermination of intelligence requirements, planning of collection effort, issuance of orders \nand requests to agencies and continuous monitoring of the productivity of such agencies.  \nThis involves the following activities.  \n• The commander  and their staff will begin to formulate Information and Intelligence \nrequirements , some of which will be  commander’s critical information requirements \n(CCIRs).  \n• Ensuring intelligence requirements are captured, processed  and actioned by the ISR \nstaff for collection and process, exploit and disseminate activity.  \nFigure 1.2 The Intelligence Cycle  \n \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 9 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Monitoring intelligence activity to ensure that the right information, includi ng\ni\nndicators and warnings,  is being collected, analysed and disseminated.\n•Ensuring that intelligence activities are conducted in a timely manner  and wher e\ndel\nays are occurring, re -tasking or reprioritising as required.\n•Planning the production, in combination with intelligence requirements management\nand collection management (IRM&CM).\nCollection (Step 2 of Int elligence  Cycle ) (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3.1 8) \n1.20.  Collection Overview .  Collection may be described as the gathering and exploitation \nof data and information by specialists and agencies and the delivery of the results obtained \nto the appropriate processing unit for use in the production of intelligence.  It comprises \nsearch, retrieval and receipt of data, information and intelligence from external sources. \nCollection within the intelligence cycle does not refer to the application of sensors and collection capabilities against requirements; this falls within the ISR TCPED process. \nCollection refers to the harvesting of the results and outputs from the ISR process and other \nsources for use by intelligence staff and  analysts.  \n1.21.  Sources.   An Agency will \ncollect information from its own resources or from a source. There \nare 3 groups of sources, Controlled, \nUncontrolled, and Casual .     \n1.22.  Agencies . An agency is \ndefined as: in intelligence usage, an organisation or individual engaged in \ncollecting and/or processing information.  An agency is different \nfrom a source because a source \nproduces raw data while an agency, \nwhich has a collection capability, also \npossesses some degree of processing capability and can provide \nintelligence. Agencies can be \nnational (for example, State \nSecurity Bure au) or multinational \n(for example, NATO , CIA or MI6 ) \n1.23.  Timeliness is vital .  The agency  or source  must deliver information in the required \ntime.  This is defined either as Response Time (total time from initiation of RFI to receipt of  \nanswer) or Reporting Time (time from detection of information to analyst receiving it and \ntherefore able to start processing).  \n1.\n24  The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Collection Requirements \nList. The collection requirements list (CRL) is generated by the collection management staff \nand integrates requirements from both the operations staff and the intelligence staff. It aims to match requirements with specific collection assets and directly supports the intelligence \ncollection plan and the operational and targeting requirements. Having determined which assets best suit the task, collection m anagement . \nFigure 1.3 The Intelligence Collection Management Process  \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 1.25 Relationship between the intelligence cycle and intelligence, surveillance and \nreconnaissance .  The ISR process is synchronised with the intelligence and operations  \ncycles.  Although the ISR process is frequently aligned with the collection and processing \nphases of the intelligence cycle, it is not exclusively aligned,  especially where ISR assets are \nsupporting operations directly and in real time.   Figure 1.4 illustrates the alignment of the ISR \nprocess and the intelligence and decision cycles.  \nProcessing ( Step 3 of Intelligence Cycle)  (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3. 30) \n1.26.  Processing ( and analysis) Overview .  Processing is defined as: the conversion of \ninformation into intelligence through collation, evaluation, analysis, integration and \ninterpretation.  Processing is the function of the intelligence cycle in which collected \ninformation and data is converted into intelligence to meet intelligence requirements. For \nclarity in this  doctrine, it has been subdivided into processing and analysis,  \n•Processing.  T he processing steps describing how information is made usable for\nthe analyst\n•Analysis.  A nalysis steps covering  how the analyst then makes this valuable for the\ncustomer.\nBoth steps  must occur to achieve the overall aim. Processing and analysis are iterative  and \nmay generate further collection requirements before the intelligence is  disseminated. .   \n1.27.  Processing.  Rarely can the information and data acquired during collection be \nunderstood without considerable effort. Processing forms the interface between collection and analysis, and between the ISR process and the intelligence cycle.   Processing within the \nintelligence cycle consists of collation, interpretation and evaluation. \nFigure 1.4 Showing the synchronisation  between the intelligence cycle and the ISR process . \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 11 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Collation .  Collation draws together information from disparate sources that ar e\nr\nelevant to the same intelligence requirement. It establishes the foundation for bot h\ni\nnterpretation and evaluation by providing a structure in which the informati on\ngat\nhered can be contextualised and cross -referenced and, in doing so, underpins\nanalysis\n•Interpretation .  Interpretation extracts meaning from collection products so they can\nbe fully and appropriately used during the analysis phase. These products may have\nbeen partially processed electronically beforehand, such as the conversion of ‘raw’\ntechnical data into imagery or searchable databases. Interpretation goes beyond this\nthough to draw out the relevance of information for later analysis.\n•Evaluation .  Evaluation is an appraisal of the quality of the reported information,\nwhich is key to determining the reliability of the originator or source and the credibility\nof the information.   During this process the intelligence is graded.  Evaluation is vital\nfor all aspects of intelligence analysis because it determines the weight that can  be\npl\naced on a specific source and its reporting when forming analytic judgements.\nSources must be evaluated for the accuracy and trustworthiness of their information,\nan activity sometimes referred to as validation.\nReliability of Source  Credability of Information  \nA    Completely reliable  1    Confirmed by other sources  \nB    Usually reliable  2    Probably true  \nC    Fairley reliable  3.Possibly true\nD    Not usually reliable  4    Doubtful  \nE    Unreliable  5    Improbable  \nF    Reliability cannot be judged  6    Truth cannot be judged  \n1.28.  Analysis.  Analysis  is principally human cognitive functions, depending on creative \nthinking to address gaps in information or understanding and critical thinking to assess \nimplications for the requirement.  Analysts should remain aware of, and consciously address, \nthe impact of  personal and subjective intellectual bias, adding structur al checks and enabling \nchallenge.  Analysis should also link back to processing as gaps are revealed or information \nFigure 1.5 Processing and Analysis within  the Intelligence Cycle  \nFigure 1.6 NATO Intelligence Grading System  \n4-02-01 \n4–02–01 - 12 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 needs to be re- evaluated in the light of links identified.  Analysis consists of synthesis, \nassessment and production:  \n• Synthesis. Synthesis is achieved by identifying links, patterns and anomalies in the \nprocessed information, resulting in descriptive explanations of what something does, \nhow it works, what is happening in a situation, etc.  As such, it can be an end in its \nown right, generating basic  and current intelligence.  However, it can also be used to \nunderpin assessments depending on the intelligence requirement.    \n• Assessment . Assessment builds on synthesis to answer the linked questions of ‘so \nwhat?’, ‘what next?’ and ‘what if?’. It involves making judgements about what the \nexplanations mean for customers in the context  of their SIR, providing insight and \nforesight. This is often associated with  predictive analysis, but also includes \njudgements about the implications of a  subject (for example, a particular capability, \nsituation or event) for a decision.   The two primary considerations for analysts in \nconducting assessment are probability  and their level of analytical confidence.  \no Probability . Since assessments are generated using incomplete, potentially \nunreliable and/or unknowable information, judgements should include the \nprobability that each hypothesis is true or that outcomes (future hypotheses or \nscenarios) will occur. Defence Intelligence mandates the use of the \nuncertainty yardstick (see Fig 1.7 ), which indicates to customers a probability \nrange against a standardised qualitative term for each intelligence product  \no Analytical confidence.  The main purpose of evaluating analytical \nconfidence is to enable articulation of the strengths and weaknesses of \nanalytical judgements. In addition to communicating this to decision- makers, \nevaluations of analytical confidence can be used for quality assurance and preparing for follow -up work as it highlights aspects of analysis that could be \nimproved.  Analytical confidence is divided into three categories, each of \nwhich comprise different sets of criteria for evaluation.  \n Information base  – the information and sources on which an \nassessment is based.  \n Analytical rigour  – the analytical processes and tools/methods  \napplied to the information.  \n Complexity and volatility – the inherent properties of the  \nenvironment being analysed (that may influence judgement stability).  \n• Production . Production captures the results in forms that will clearly and effectively \ncommunicate those results and judgements to decision- makers.  Production lies on \nthe interface between processing and dissemination, and is integral to making \nanalysis truly valuable to customers.  \n \nFigure 1.7 Assessment \nProbability Yardstick \nGraphic . \n4-02-01\n4–02–01 - 13 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Dissemination  (Step 4 of Intelligence Cycle) (JDP 2 -00 from Para 3. 49) \n1.29.  Dissemination Overview .  Intelligence is useless if it is given too late to those who \nneed it to act on it.  Dissemination is defined as: ‘ the timely conveyance of intelligence, in \nappropriate forms and means, to those who need it. ’  Getting intelligence to the user at the \nright time and in the appropriate format is essential for successful intelligence operations.    \n1.30.  Requirement Management . Requirement management is as vital in the \ndissemination phase as it is in direction and collection. Wherever possible, initial tasking \nshould include the requirement for direct dissemination and the means by which this should \nbe achieved.  \n1.31.  Dissemination  Management . It is important for intelligence staff to manage the \ndissemination process continuously. Without effective management, communications paths can become saturated by information.    \n1.32.  Push and Pull Principles.  The push concept allows for higher formations to push \ninformation down to lower levels of command to satisfy intelligence requirements and for \nlower levels of command to push intelligence upward.  The pull concept involves using cloud \nstorage, knowledge repositories, databases, intelligence files or other data and information repositories that are accessible to intelligence organisations at all levels of command. \nIntelligence products should be organised and presented using web- based technologies and \nuniversally recognised standards within Defence.  \n1.33.  Dissemination Methods. Intelligence is disseminated by three core methods: verbal \nbriefing, printed material and electronically.  Electronic means  of storing and accessing \ninformation have and will continue to develop at pace, thereby enhancing the ability of \nintelligence users at all levels to access  material directly rather than being reliant on \nreceiving cascaded information, data or assessments.  \n1.34.  Formatting . After determining who needs to receive each report, intelligence staff \nmust determine how much of the report each user requires and in what format.  \nConsiderations include the decision- makers requirements or preferences, user requirement, \nspeed of transmission, the available bandwidth, legal restrictions and security classification . \n1.35.  Principles of D issemination .  Dissemination is governed by the principles of: \nlatency, appropriateness, urgency, distribution and security : \n•Latency.  There are two aspects to latency. The first is when dissemination is toolate for an intended purpose and is thus redundant. The second refers to intelligenc\ne\nt\nhat is time sensitive, where accuracy decays or the information loses its value wit h\nt\nhe passage of time.\n•Appropriateness. Disseminated intelligence should enhance understanding and be\nin an accessible format. J2 staff will ensure the appropriateness of intelligence tomeet the user’s needs, and make  sure that it is intelligible and disseminated across a\nsuitable system.\n•Urgency. Whenever possible, information obtained to meet an intelligenc\ne\nr\nequirement should be converted into intelligence before dissemination. However,\nwhen time is at a premium, the full processing and analysis of information may not bepossible and dissemination should be undertaken as quickly as possible, with the\ncaveat that it is unprocessed and may not be reliable.\n•Distribution. Intelligence staff are responsible for ensuring that all intelligence is\ndisseminated to those who need it. The commander and intelligence staff mayrequire the distribution of additional summaries of intelligence to other agencies\n and\nf\normations outside the normal chain of command, such as partners across\ngovernment.\n4-02-01 \n4–02–01 - 14 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • Security .  Intelligence should be classified at the level required and not be over -\nclassified. Over -classification causes delays in handling and transmission. The use of \n‘tear-lines’ can balance the requirement to maintain security and protect the source \nwhilst allowing for the greatest possible distribution. There may be occasions when \nthe risk of compromising the source has to be weighed against the value of the \ninformation.  \n1.36.  NATO reporting formats. Uses NATO standards for report formats and message \nsets to guarantee multinational interoperability.Wherever possible, written and web- based \nintelligence reports should be consistent with the NATO formats in the Table.  \nREPORT  DESCRIPTION  \nIntelligence Report  \n(INTREP)  Sent whenever information or intelligence is urgent  and contains any \ndeductions that can be made in the time available. INTREPs can comprise \nthreat reporting  containing unprocessed data and information  \nIntelligence  \nSummary  \n(INTSUM)  A concise, periodic summary of intelligence about the  current situation within \nthe joint operations area. It is  designed to update the current intelligence \npicture and to highlight important developments during the reporting period \nand includes any information or  intelligence relevant to extant intelligence \nrequirements.  \nSupplementary  \nIntelligence Report  \n(SUPINTREP)  A stand -alone summary of intelligence for a given  subject or situation. It \nupdates the current intelligence picture, addressing a specific issue or \nhighlighting  important developments inside the normal reporting  cycle.  \nSingle -source \nReports  Other intelligence reports and summaries are  periodically generated to \naddress specific subjects,  for example, interrogation reports and technical  \nintelligence reports.  \nCounter ‑intelligence  \nReports  Similar to INTREPs, counter -intelligence (CI)  reports comprise CI -INTREPs, \nCI-INTSUMs and  CI‑SUPINTREPs. Counter -intelligence staff may also \nproduce threat assessments and threat warnings to  inform commanders of \nspecific security threats.  \nThematic Reports  These address aspects of the operating environment, such as a geographic \nlocation, a political or religious movement or a particular adversary \norganisation.  \n \nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 CYBER AND ELECTROMAGNETIC OPERATIONS  \nReference: UK Cyber Primer  3rd Edition . \n2.1. The Cyber and E lectromagnetic Domain .  The capabilities and activities relating  \nto cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment  are placed together as a single  \noperational domain.   The cyber and electromagnetic domain is defined as: “a domain \ncomprising capabilities  which enable activities that maintain freedom of action by creating \neffects in  and through cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum .” \n2.2. Cyber and Electromagnetic Operations.  Cyber and electromagnetic operations \ncomprise of a series of interrelated disciplines. \n•Cyber operations . Cyber\noperations concern planni ng and\ns\nynchronising activities i n and\nt\nhrough cyberspace to enabl e\nf\nreedom of manoeuvre and to\nachieve military objectives.\n•Information operations .\nI\nnformation operations may p lan\nt\no deliver information activities\nusing cyber operations\ncapabilities. Therefore,\ninformation operations staff must\nbe aware of the cyber capability\nof the force.\n•Electromagnetic operations .\nE\nlectromagnetic operations are\ndefined as: all operations that shape or exploit the electromagnetic  environment or  use it for attack or defenc\ne\ni\nncluding the use of  the electromagnetic environment to support operations in all\nother operational environments. Note: Electromagnetic operations include (but ar e\nnot\n limited to) electromagnetic warfare, signals intelligence, intelligence,\nsurveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, navigation warfare,\nbattlespace spectrum management.\n•Signals intelligence . Signals intelligence is defined as: intelligence derived from\nelectromagnetic signals or emissions. Note: the main subcategories of signals\nintelligence are communications intelligence and electromagnetic intelligence.\nCyber and signals intelligence are,  to an extent, reliant on similar infrastructures,\norganisations, accesses,  personnel training and skill sets.\n•Communication and information systems . Communication and informati on\ns\nystems are essential to facilitate the enable role of cyber  operations .\n2.3. Electromagnetic spectrum  (EMS) .  The EMS covers different types of electronic \nradiation from radio waves through visible light to gamma rays.  From a military perspective, \nthe EMS can be used indirectly, as a bearer for information, or directly as a means of creating an effect.  It is in the former that the EMS and cyber have their relationship as \nelectromagnetic energy enables the linking of computer networks and infrastructure.  \n2.4. What is Electronic Warfare (EW) ?  EW is defined as ‘military action that exploits \nElectro -Magnetic (EM) energy to provide situational awareness and achieve offensive and \ndefensive effects. It comprises the following electromagnetic activities:  \n•Electronic Attack (EA) . The use of EM energy for offensive purposes.\n•Electronic Defence (ED) . The use of EM energy to provide protection and to\nensure effective friendly use of the EM spectrum.\nFigure 2.1 Cyber and electromagnetic operating context\nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Electronic Surveillance (ES) . The use of EM energy to provide SA and\nintelligence.\n•Electronic Warfare Management .  This is the capability to coordinate and\ndeconflict electronic warfare activities and, as such, is fundamental to coordinati ng\nC\nEMA.\n2.5. EW Tasks.\n•Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) . ESM are actions taken to search\nfor, intercept, and identify EM emissions, and to locate their sources for th e\npur\npose of immediate threat recognition.\n•Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) . ECM are actions taken to prevent or\nreduce an enemy’s effective use of EMS through the use of EM energy.\no Electronic Jamming. Electronic jamming is the deliberate radiation, re-\nradiation or reflection of EM energy, with the object of impairing the\neffectiveness of electronic devices, equipment or systems being used by a n\nenem\ny.  Coordination of jamming is an operations staff responsibility execut ed\nby\n the EW staff in consultation with the Intelligence, Spectrum Management\n(SM) and wider CIS staff. It should be undertaken at the highest level of\ncommand, but control should be vested in the appropriate tactical\ncommander.\no Electronic Deception . Electronic deception is the deliberate radiation, re -\nradiation, alteration, absorption or reflection of EM energy in a mannerintended to confuse, distract or coerce an enemy or his electronic systems.  It\nmust be considered during the planning phase of any deception plan.\nDeception is an operations staff responsibility with assistance fromintelligence staff and the EW planning staff.  EW staff assist the intelligenc\ne\ns\ntaff in providing information on the enemy use of the EMS, their\nvulnerabilities, surveillance capabilities and the enemy’s reaction to deception.\no Electronic Neutralisation. Electronic neutralisation is ‘the deliberate use ofEM energy to either temporarily or permanently damage enemy devices whic\nh\nr\nely exclusively on the EMS’.  Electronic neutralisation is usually brought\nabout as a result of a Direct Energy Weapon (DEW) depositing sufficient EMenergy on a target to render it ineffective. For example, the use of lasers t\no\ndam\nage or destroy optical devices.\n•Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) . EPM are actions taken to ensur e\nef\nfective friendly use of the EMS despite the enemy’s use of EM energy.\no Active EPM . Active EPM involves the use of detectable protective measures,\nsuch as a change in frequencies or the re -radiation of a signal using reflectors\nor repeaters.\no Passive EPM . Passive EPM measures are undetectable to the enemy an d\ni\nnvolve:\n Reducing transmission power to a level which is sufficient to maintai n\nc\nommunications.\n Making maximum use of codes, ciphers and encryption.\n Careful siting and use of directional antennas to reduce the risk of\ndetection and degrade the accuracy of adversary DF.\n The use of SOPs to reduce the need for communications and keep EMemissions to a minimum.\n The use of SOPs for countering enemy jamming and deception.\n Strict Emission Control (EMCON) measures, which either forbid or limitEM emissions during certain phases of the battle.\nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 2.6. Cyberspace.  There are no universally accepted definitions  for cyber, however  the \nfollowing definition will be used: “The global environment consisting of all interconnected \ncommunication, information technology and other electronic systems, networks and their \ndata, including those which are separated or independent, which process, store or transmit \ndata. ” \n2.7. The Cyber Challenge .  The Armed Force’s  ability to conduct protective operations \nin cyberspace is mission critical, demands resilience and facilitates decision superiority. Our adversaries will contest our freedom of manoeuvre in cyberspace so we need to have \ncapabilities that can identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from attacks against our \ndigital systems and communication networks . \n2.8. The Layers of Cyberspace.  Cyberspace can be thought of as comprising  six \ninterdependent layers: social; people; persona; information; network and geographic. These \nlayers can be placed within three effect dimensions, as  shown in Figure 2.2. below  \n2.9. How do you access Cyberspace?   Access to cyberspace is possible via many \nmeans, most often through computer terminals, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. \nConnectivity may be achieved via wireless connections or physical cables. Cyberspace is dependent upon physical assets – power sources, cables, networks, data -centres, as well as \nthe people who operate and manage them.  \n2.10.  How is Cyber used by Adversaries?   Cyberspace is permanently contested by \nour adversaries, who exploit areas such as:  \n•Corrupting and stealing sensitive information;Figure 2.2 Layers of Cyberspace and their relationship with the 3 effects dimensions . \n\nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 2025 •Denying services on telecommunications, commercial databases and websites;\n•Damaging industrial control systems (ICS) such as supervisory control and data\nacquisition systems (SCADA); distributed control systems (DCS) and\nprogrammable logic controls (PLC).\n2.11.  Forms and Methods of Cyber Attack .  The cyber toolbox includes (but is not \nlimited to) social engineering, malware, local physical access and supply chain corruption.  \n2.12.  Cyber Operations.  Cyber operations are  defined as: “ The planning and \nsynchronisation of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of manoeuvre and to achieve military Objectives ” There are four distinct but interdependent roles:  \n•Influence Role.\n•Defend Role.\n•Enable Role.\n•Inform  Role.\n2.13.  Influence Role .  The influence role enables cyber and electromagnetic capabilities \nto shape (defeat, deceive, degrade and deny) adversaries’  capabilities, which allows our \nforces  to mould the behaviour of audiences and the course of events .  There are four t ypes \nof missions/ activities : \n•Offensive Cyber Operations . These are defined as: “ activities that project power\nto achieve military objectives in or through cyberspace”.  They can be used to inflict\npermanent or temporary effects, thus reducing an adversary’s confidence in theirnetworks, information or other capabilities for a specific period.  Offensive cyber\nactivity is commonly broken into seven phases, known as the cyberattack chain.\nThe phases are not discrete events, instead they interact and overlap with eac\nh\not\nher and may vary in duration. They are equally applicable to the actions of a\nstate or criminal and are illustrated in Fig 2.3 below.\n•Cyber Information Operations.\n•Counter Cyber.\n•Electromagnetic Attack .\n2.\n14. Defend Role - Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO).   Defensive Cyber Operations  \nare defined as: “ active and passive measures  taken to prevent, nullify or reduce the \neffectiveness of adversary actions to  preserve our freedom of action in or through \ncyberspace ”.   \n•Active Defence: Activities that target hostile offensive cyber operations in order t o\npr\neserve  our freedom of manoeuvre within cyberspace.\n•Passive D efence : Threat specific defensive measures to reduce the effectiveness\nof cyber  activity.\n2.15.  Enable Role . Enable is a foundation role, is a vital function; it harnesses, manages \nand operates the communication and information systems infrastructure controlled by the \nArmed Forces.   Enable activities include: \n•Electromagnetic Spectrum Management,\n•Digital Service Integration and Management,\n•Network Operations.\n•Information Assurance.\n2.16.  Inform Role:  The inform role underpins all the other roles as it secures freedom of  \naction to engage with the cyber and electromagnetic domain. This is achieved through the \ndevelopment of appropriate knowledge and understanding. \nFigure 2.3 The Cyber Attack Chain  \nSERIAL 4-02-02 \n4–02–02 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16  – May 202 5 • Cyber ISR .

It is no coincidence , therefore,  that \nInformation  is both an  instrument of power , at the strategic level , and is one of the joint \nfunctions , at the operational and tactical levels , and as such forms part of Joint Action .  The \njoint force needs to understand  how information shapes the environment in which it operates  \nand how best to use information to influe nce and change behaviours , along with the other \njoint functions.    \n5.2 This serial will first consider what is influence, then  it will describe  how the joint force \nis organised to use information .  It will then go on to explain  Strategic Communications , \nInformation Operations and Psychological  Operations; Media Operations are described in \nSerial 4-02-06.   \n5.3 Influence Defined .  Allied Joint Doctrine for Information Operations defines influence  \nas: “The capacity to have an effect on the character or behaviour of someone or something\nor the effect itself”. \n5.4 Influencing Human Behaviour .  For any beh aviour to occur there  are three factors \nrequired: Capability, Opportunity and Motivation - see Figure 5.1 below.  Capability can be \npsychological (knowledge) or physical (skills); opportunity can be social (societal influences) \nor physical (environmental resources); motivation can be automatic(emotion) or reflective \n(beliefs, intentions) .  When these factors are analysed possible opportunities for attitude or \nbehaviour change through the use of information  can be identified .  Noting that humans \nreceive their information through a number of inputs , their senses and how they feel \nphysically, with the majority of information com ing through eyesight and hearing.   \nFigure 5.1: Capability  Opportunity Motivation  Behaviour  Model  (COM -B) (adapted)  \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 2 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 5.5 Military Influence is delivered by Joint Action .  The capacity that a military force \ncan use to influence are its elements of Joint Action: Manoeuvre, Fires, Information  and \nCIMIC .  The military force needs to understand where to deliver this capacity, at someone or \nsomething , and what behaviour or character it is seeking to change.    \n5.6 Strategic Communication – STRATCOM1.  NATO has recently introduced a \ncommand group function called Strategic Communication or STRATCOM  realising the \nimportance of the information environment to the current character of competition .  NATO \ndefines STRATCOM function as:  \n‘The integration of communication capabilities and the information staff function with \nother military activities, in order to understand and shape the information \nenvironment, in support of aims and objectives. ’\nThis function , which is used by all levels of command , is responsible for understanding the \ninformation environment across all relevant audiences and, based on that understanding, \nusing all means of communication – comprising actions, images and words – to \nappropriately  inform and influence an audience's attitudes and behaviours through a \nnarrative -led approach in pursuit of the desired end state.   \n5.7 STRATCOM Organisation .  The STRATCOM function comprises of four functional \nareas : STRATCOM, Information Operations, Psychological Operations and Media \nOperations  as sho wn on Figure 5.2.  \nFigure 5.2 STRATCOM functional areas  \n5.8 STRATCOM .  The STRATCOM cell provides the central staff for the STRATCOM \nfunction.  It receives and interprets the STRATCOM directive which is part of the Strategic \nPlanning Guidance .  On behalf of the commander it develops STRATCOM direction and \nguidance , which includes:  \na. STRATCOM frameworks  – these  are the primary direction and guidance\ndocuments for the planning and execution of activities .  It will typically contain: a\nnarrative and/or  core message; defined audiences; STRATCOM objectives;\nSTRATCOM these; focus topics; coordination and any additional annexes.\n1 STRATCOM is used as a noun  in this context  which describes a function .  The Strategic o r STRAT  \nelement of the phrase does not  relate to the strategic level of warfare.   NATO have introduced a new \nstaff branch, J10, as a focus for STRATCOM.  MAJCSC will not use the J10 branch  until it is adopted \nby the UK.      \n\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 3 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 b. STRATCOM Implementation Guidance.\nc. Integrated Communications Plans .\nd. Mission specific narratives .\ne. STRATCOM Annex to the OPLAN.\n5.9 Narratives .  A narrative is defined as ‘ A spoken or written account of events and\ninformation arranged in a logical sequence to influence the behaviour of a target audience. ’2 \nA narrative is a story designed to provide an emotive justification for a policy, and in many \ncases how that policy  is to be realised and the moral authority for doing so.  The policy is the \ndesire to move to a future state or maintain a current state (the ends).  The strategy is the \nplan to get to that state (employing ways and means to achieve the ends).  The narrati ve \nprovides the ‘ why? ’ It provides a justification for action, and a justification can be very \nsubjective.  \n5.10   Strategic Narrative .  The strategic narrative, written at the strategic level, must \nspeak to a broad swathe of audiences in a manner that allows them to understand it and be \npositively influenced by it, despite language and cultural differences.  Therefore, for Defence \nactivity to be effective, it requires sound strategy and a supporting narrative.  The narrative \nwill help guide planning and give meaning to actions, when perceived by audiences.  The \npervasive nature of information means the perception of activity is as important as the \nactivity itself. Narratives must compete to connect with audiences and to endure.   Narratives \nare usually strategic and written and held at this level.  Narratives can be written at lower \nlevels, such as the CJTF level but probably no lower.   A strategic narrative should comprise \nthe following elements:  \n• The current state : a description of the wrong to be righted or the desirable\ncondition to be retained.\n• The future state : a description of the ends, be it a maintenance of the current\nstate or a transition.\n• The pathway : how to get there.\n• The justification : why the proposed change of state, or maintenance of the\ncurrent state, is better than the alternatives; validating the pathway.  The\njustification is usually woven into the other three elements.\n5.11 Information Operations .  Information Operations  (Info Ops)  is a staff function to \nanalyse, plan, integrate and assess information activities to create desired effects on the will, \nunderstanding and capability of adversaries, potential adversaries and audiences in support \nof mission objectives.  Info Ops staff turn the STRATCOM direction into actionable plans , in \nthe form of Information Activities , and as such provide input into the J3 and J5 staff \nbranches.  Information Activities only take place within the  Joint Operations Area (JOA)  and \nare delivered by military forces . Info Ops has  six functions:  \n• Information environment assessment.\n• Information operations planning.\n• Information activities synchronization and integration.\n• Engagement.\n• Contribution to joint targeting.\n• Counter -hostile information activities.\n2 AJP 10.1 Information Operations page Lex -10. \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 4 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 5.12 Information Operations Principles .  Info Ops is based on certain principles that \nshape its role within the planning and joint targeting processes  and thus directs the way in \nwhich information activities support the execution and achievement of objectives across the \nfull range of campaign themes.   \n• Comprehensive understanding .   The foundation for Info Ops is derived\nfrom understanding the commander’s objectives, guidance and intent, the \nSTRATCOM direction and guidance and a comprehensive understanding of the \ninformation environment, the audiences that inhabit it and how information impacts \nthem in the operating environment.  \n• Narrative -led.  Actions, images and words, derived from the narrative, must\nbe coherent with one another at all levels – strategic, operational and tactical.\n• Effects focused .  Info Ops planners must identify the effects required to\nachieve objectives and then, through their understanding of the information\nenvironment, select the appropriate activity or combination of activities to create\nthose effect s.  These activities  are delivered by Psychological and Media\nOperations  working with and through elements of the joint force .\n• Integrated .  All activities will have a resultant cognitive effect and Info Ops\nstaff must be integrated throughout the planning and targeting process to recognize\nand explain the behavioural change from activities.\n• Agility .  Info Ops staff must be agile and responsive to a continually evolving\ninformation environment.  They must persistently monitor, assess and evaluate\neffects in the operating environment to allow rapid adjustment to be made when\nrequired.\n• Centrali sed planning and decentrali sed execution .  Due to the\nrequirement to fully integrate the Info Ops staff, the principles of centrali sed\nplanning and decentrali sed execution apply at all levels of command.  Therefore,\ncommanders should be prepared to accept risk and delegate authority to the lowest\npractical level .\n• Assessment .   A key part of Info Ops is an effective assessment of the short\nand long -term effects of activities, directed towards objectives.  It is recognized that\nbehavioural change is not usually immediate.  Attention is focused on indicators of\ndesired change or desired sustainment of an audience’s behaviour, such as political\nactivity and expressions of unrest, or changes in the perception or attitude of the\ncivilian population.\nThere are a number of additional capabilities and techniques which may be integrated as  \npart of  information activities  – these may include: Cybersp ace operations, EW, CIMIC, \nphysical destruction, OPSEC, deception and presence, posture and profile.  \n5.13 Info Ops  Planning  - Analyse .  The Info Ops staff provide the commander with an \nanalysis and assessment of the information environment as part of the comprehensive \nunderstanding of the operational environment (CUOE) . This analysis and assessment in \nconducted in a number of ways:  \na. Information Environment .   The Information Environment is made up of 3\nDimensions .  These dimensions are further segmented into seven layers  as shown in\nFigure 5.3.\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 5 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25  \n \n(1) Information Dimensions .   There are three dimensions: the cognitive \ndimension where the brain gathers and processes information; the virtual \ndimension is how we communicate and the physical dimension is the real \nworld where nation states, cultures and societies interact.   \n(2) Information Inter -Relationships .   The interconnected nature of the \ndimensions and their respective layers allow  identification of  potential targets \nand the interrelated aspects of the information environment.  \n(3) Characteristics of the Modern Information Environment . \n• Borderless .   The information environment is essentially \nborderless.  Information can move around the world in seconds and in \nan almost unrestricted manner.  \n• Alternative Voices .   The information environment has many \nalternative voices.  The public are able to comment on almost any \nissue via the medium of social media with little or no editorial control.  \n• Competing Messages .   With many alternative voices, come \nmany competing messages.  These will both support or oppose many \ndifferent issues.  \n• Barriers to Entry .   The ability to operate in the information \nenvironment is relatively inexpensive.  Anyone with a smartphone and \naccess to data would be able to contribute.  \nb. Information Environment Analysis (IEA) .   The Info Ops staff conduct IEA \non behalf of the commander.  It compliments JIPOE, and like it, is a process that \nFigure 5.3: The Information Environment  \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 6 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 requires continuous updating as the situation develops. IEA  consist of 5 areas of \nanalysis: Baseline, Human Factors, Communications, Audience and B ehaviour.   \nThese are illustrated in Figure 5.4 below and AJP 10.1 Chapter 4 has more detail.  \n(1) Baseline Analysis .   The baseline analysis is the foundation of\nunderstanding for an operation.  It is informed by J2 assessments but much of\nthe contents of this analysis can be found via open sources.\n(2) Human Factor Analysis .   A summary of the key deductions of the\nhuman factors analysis is often displayed using the PMESII/ASCOPE analysis\ntool as can be found at Serial 3-01-06.\n(3) Communications A nalysis .   The communications – messaging – of\nall actors within a crisis inform s the IEA.  This requires analysis of narratives\n(both friendly and adversary), analysis of adversary messages, own\nmessages and other key actors.\n(4) Audience Analysis .   An Audience is defined as, ‘an individual, group\nor entity whose interpretation of events and subsequent behaviour may affect\nthe attainment of the end state.’  To understand and effect changes in an\naudience’s attitudes and behaviours, it requires an understanding of\naudiences to identify those who can influence the end state and their current \nactivities, perceptions and behaviours . Audiences are  part of 3 main \ncategories: Public, Stakeholder or Actor.  A shade shift diagram can be \nconstructed to ‘segment’  identified audiences and to determine which \npotential cognitive effects could be applied to these audiences  to achieve the \nend state.   From this potential target audiences can be developed, which are \nthose which activities can be directed to create desired effects.   Audiences \nand their analysis, and the shade shift are at Serial 1 -02-01.   \n(5) Behaviour Analysis .   Behaviour analysis seeks to identify the\nbehavioural vulnerabilities and opportunities of an approved target audience\nto support the planning of activities.   AJP 10.1 lists several approaches in\nChapter 4.\nFigure 5.4: Information Environment  Analysis  \nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 7 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 5.14 Info Ops  Planning  - Plan .   Info Ops staff must have a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the HQ operations planning process so that they are able to contribute to it \nat every stage.  As shown in Figure 5.5 below.   \n \n• Initiation .   The IEA starts during initiation.    \n• Mission Analysis .  Develop further the IEA and integrate with the JIPOE. \nConduct f actor, narrative and CoG analys is. Develop shade shift, possible effects \nand target audiences to be agreed . \n• COA Development .   Develop effects and assessment criteria for COAs.  \nPropose Info Ops targets to the targeting board.  \n• COA Analysis .   Refine the Info Ops input to each COA and support \nwargaming.  \n• COA Validation and Comparison .   Use behavioural analysis to support \nevaluation of COAs.  \n• Comd’s Decision .   Provide Info Ops input into CONOPs for each COA.  \n• Plan Development .   Provide IEA and Info Ops appendices to OPLAN.    \n \n  \n5.15 Info Ops  Planning  - Integrate .   Info Ops coordinat e and integrate the STRATCOM \ndirection and guidance horizontally within headquarters.  The primary purpose is creating \ncognitive effects, or more broadly supporting activities that are designed for physical and or \nvirtual effect and have an informational el ement to them.  As such Info Ops staff must be \nfully integrated into the headquarters battle rhythm attending the correct working groups and \nboards.

Information Activities Working Group  (IAWG) .   A separate IAWG may be\nconvened or this activity may form part of the Joint Target ing Coordination Board\n(JTCB).  Irrespective of where it sits , it must ensure that information activities are\ncoherent and synchronised across the headquarters .\nb. Joint Targeting .   Info Ops staff will develop target materials for information\nactivities, which will be validated, approved and prioriti sed through the joint targeting\nprocess for resource allocation and effects employment.\nc. Execution .   Info Ops targets will be delivered  by either PsyOps or Media\nOps working with and through elements of the joint force.\n5.16 Info Ops  Planning  - Assess .   Assessment seeks to analyse and report on the \nperformance and effectiveness of information activities to provide feedback to decision -\nmakers so that information activities can be modified where necessary to achieve the \ndesired results. Because there is alw ays a delay between cause and effect of information \nactivities, assessment is not immediate. Access to audiences being affected is not always \npossible but Info Ops staff should identify indicators and warnings for information activities to \npredict and obse rve behavioural changes over time.   MOPs and MOEs can be developed for \ninformation activities as for the rest of the joint actions and can be reported via the \nheadquarters assessment process , the Assessment WG and the Assessment Board .  \n5.17 Psychological Operations .    Psychological Operations or PsyOps are planned \nactivities using methods of communication and other means directed at approved audiences \nin order to influence perceptions, attitudes and behaviours, affecting the achievement of \npolitical and military ob jectives.  The primary purpose of PsyOps is to influence approved \ntarget audiences to have a direct effect on both understanding and will, together with an \nindirect effect on capability.  Their key responsibilities are:  \na. Audience Analysis .   The PsyOps staff provides audience research and\ntarget audience analysis to the IEA.\nb. Psychological Operations planning .   The PsyOps staff provides specialist\nPsyOps advice to the planning process.\nc. Counter -hostile information and disinformation .   The PsyOps staff\nsupports counter -hostile information and disinformation activities through their\ncontribution to the IEA function and coordination with the Info Ops staff.\nd. Web operations .   The PsyOps   staff can plan and execute focused digital\nengagement activities with approved audiences as part of a coordinated\ncommunications campaign as part of joint operations.\n5.18 Psychological Operations  Planning . \na. What effect is to be achieved and what behavioural change is sought?\nFor each target audience we must confirm what effects are to be achieved.  PsyOps\nplanners need to be precise in the meaning of the effects.  The current behaviour of\nthe target audience needs to be understood: what does this behaviour mean and\nwhat is the audience achieving by it?  The desired behaviour also must be described:\nwhat  behaviour do we want the target audience to exhibit after we have applied our\neffects?  These are developme nts of the a udience and actor analysis conducted by\nInfo Ops.\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 9 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 b. Who is the message directed at, who is the target audience?   PsyOps\nplanners take the identified audiences and analyse them further.  An\nASCOPE/PMESII -PT analysis is conducted on each audience.  The audience’s\nrelationships with other audiences on the shade shift should be examined for\nstrengths and weaknesses, e.g., h ow strong are a rebel group ties to the main enemy\nforce we are facing? PsyOps planners need to understand the target audience's\nvulnerabilities, what freedoms do they have, how are they constrained, what cultural\nconsiderations about the audience do we ha ve to consider – which aspects can we\nuse when we start to design our messages, and which should we avoid?\nc. When is the effect to be delivered and for how long?   The Joint or\nComponent synchronisation matrices will determine when effects are to be delivered.\nPsyOps planners have to take this general direction and add detail to it and plan\nwhen actions and activity will occur.  The time dimension is critical to success in\nPsyOps.  Every PsyOps  product is tailored to the audience.  Products take time to\ndesign and develop, to test and evaluate.  The products then need to be delivered to\nthe audience and the message understood.  And time needs to be given for the\nnece ssary behaviour change to occur.\nd. What is the mess age and who will deliver the message?  In terms of\ndeveloping the Message, PsyOps planners will take the themes and high -level\nmessages and adapt these for the target audience based on the required effects and\nbehaviour changes sought, the target audience analysis and the timing.  The key skill\nthat the PsyOps planners bring is the ability to identify what are known as lines of\npersuasion in developing messages.  Effectively there are six lines of persuasion:\n(1) Reciprocity.   Simply put, people are obliged to give back to others\nthe form of a behaviour, gift, or service that they have received first.  So, the\nkey to using the Principle of Reciprocity is to be the first to give and to ensure\nthat what you give is personalised and unexpected.  This principle works well\nin one -on-one communication situations like key leader engagement.\n(2) Scarcity .   In many operations, the fabric of society and normal life\nhas broken down.  Simple everyday processes can almost stop. For example;\nchildren going to school; being able to walk safely in the street or go to the\nmarket.  People want more of those rare o r scarce but normal things which\nare in short supply.  In using this idea, you must point out what is unique\nabout your proposition and what they stand to lose if they fail to consider your\nproposal.  Messages can use this technique to demonstrate that these routine\nactivities can be restored ie going to market can be part of normal life again.\nThe trick is not to over promise or guarantee. “Under Promise Over Deliver” \n(UPOD).  \n(3) Authority .   This is the idea that people follow the lead of credible,\nknowledgeable experts.  This is important in selecting messengers – use\nsomeone the audience you are messaging can identify with and who has\nauthority about the message.  For example, if you are mes saging about a\nmedical issue use a medical person to do it.\n(4) Consistency .  People like to be consistent with the things they have\npreviously said and done.  Messaging must be consistent over time when\naddressing audiences and not contradictory.\nSERIAL 4-02-05 \n4–02–05 - 10 \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 16 – May 20 25 (5) Liking .   People prefer to say yes to those they like.  People like\npeople who are similar to them, who pay compliments and who cooperate\nwith them.  This can be effective if employed by those elements of the force\nwho work amongst people, to bring the people ov er to support the joint force.\nThe other side is also true, if we do not pay compliments and do not\ncooperate with people, it is much harder to succeed.\n(6) Consensus.   When they are uncertain, people will look to the actions\nand behaviours of others to determine their own.  In messaging to audiences,\nshow what others have done and what the benefits have been.\ne. How do we get the message to the audience – which channel or\nchannels to use ?   In the ASCOPE -PMESII -PT analysis you will have identified what\nmeans exist to communicate with audiences.  If they exist, then joint forces should\nseek to use them.  Some may have to be put in place.  It is likely that the message\nwill have to use more  the one channel.  So, for example, you may have to deliver a\nmessage through radio, leaflets, and word of mouth.\nf. Legal .   Finally, as messaging products are developed whether they be for\nradio or TV broadcast, online or printed they all must be cleared by a legal officer.\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 MEDIA OPERATIONS  \nThis summary is taken from AJP -10.3 (Ed A) Ver 1 Sep 2024 Doctrine for Military Public \nAffairs . (known in NATO as Military Public Affairs or Mil PA  but at MAJCSC known as Media \nOperations ).    \n6.1 The Media .   The word media is a collective noun which refers to a means of mass \ncommunication.  This covers what is known as traditional media – newspapers, television, \nradio - often referred to in English as the ‘press’ and digital media – websites, social media, \nblogs etc.    \n6.\n2 Media Operations.   Media Operations is the strategic communications \n(STRATCOM ) capability responsible for promoting military aims and objectives by \ncommunicating accurate and truthful information to internal and external audiences in a \ntimely manner.  \n6.\n3 Media Operations Principles .  Media Ops staff need to be aware of the key Media \nOps principles : \na. C\nonduct truthful narrative- led communication.    All Media Ops  efforts\nsupport commanders and staff in the execution of their mission.   Media Ops staff\ndevelop and promulgate compelling narratives that support the military aims  and\nobj\nectives in line with the commander’s priorities and in respect of the STRATCOM\nguidance.\nb. P\nrovide accurate information in a timely manner .   This is critical to\nfunctional and organisational credibility and trust with publics, internal audiences  and\nt\nhe media, and helps deter adversary disinformation.  The impact of Media Ops\nactivity is often directly proportional to the timeliness and accuracy of the Media Ops\neffort or response: information delivered quickly can have a qualitatively  different\neffect than the same information delivered a day or even an hour later.   However,\naccuracy should not be traded for speed – once official information has be en\npubl\nished it cannot be taken back.\nc. E\nnsure that information is consistent, coordinated and integrated wit h\na hi\ngher HQ .   Communication is a collective and integrated effort. Words and\nac\ntions must be aligned, and commanders ensure that their media operations provide\na consistent message, and that military information activities are well coordinated.\nd. P\nractise appropriate operations and personnel security .   OPSEC  and\nper\nsonnel security  provisions must be considered and adhered to before informati on\ni\ns released.   Protecting commanders/headquarters  against criticism or\nembarrassment is not a reason to classify or withhold information about th e\nunder\nlying issues. In general, the principle of ‘no surprise’ for higher HQ  applies.\ne. C\nonduct work with an understanding of the human environment and\nmindful of multinational sensitivities .   It is critical that the information environment\nand human environment are understood wherever operations are  conduct ed.\nOper\nations can be adversely affected by unconscious biases or culturally\ninappropriate references or imagery .  These can be prevented through applying a n\nappr\noach that includes, e.g., proper cultural, political and other analyses. Conversely\nthe effect and impact of communications is made stronger when they are informed by\nan understanding and appreciation of local custom, tradition and culture.\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.4 Roles and Responsibilities  of Media Operations at the Operational Level . \na. R\nole of the Commander.  The Commander of the JTF (JTFC) is ultimately\nresponsible for the success of the operation.  A positive public perception of t he\nC\nommander is critical to the success of the communications strategy.  The\nCommander needs to decide at an early stage the broad level of visibility  and\nex\nposure to the media he personally wishes to have.  This will determine how  he\nwis\nhes to use his Media Ops staff.  Although the Media Ops staff will cover t he\nac\ntivity of the entire force, they will always retain a direct line to the Commander, w ho\nby\n definition becomes the principal spokesman for the force.\nb. Role of Staff .  The principal role of the Media Ops staff is to achiev e\nc\nommunications effect through the delivery of messages.  Specifically, they are\nrequired to conduct a range of tasks, principally to:\n•Keep the JTFC abreast of media activity.\n•Advise the JTFC on the  alignment of  media activity to themes and\nmessages being pursued at the strategic level.\n•Assist the JTFC in his direct dealings with the media (including t he\npr\novision of a spokesman).\n•Plan, coordinate and implement facilities for media assignments.\n•Provide talking points/media lines to take in support of key information\nobjectives.\n•Handle the media aspects of serious incidents, including briefi ng and\nr\nebuttal if delegated to do so by the chain of command.\n•Provide direction to Component Commanders/subordinates and theirMedia Ops staffs.\n•Ensure press releases issued within the JOA/AO do not provideinformation of value to the enemy.\n•Implement the Operational Security (OPSEC) plan up, down and acrossall levels of media contact.\n•Conduct appropriate media monitoring and analysis.\nc. Key Media Ops Staff .  There are some key members of the Media Ops staff,\nwho will be central to delivering media ops effects:\n1. Chief Media Operations.   The Chief Media Ops is the JTFC’s\nprincipal Media Ops staff officer.  He is responsible for providing advice on the\nimplementation of STRATCOM  direction from the JTFC  and for Media Ops\nplanning and briefing.  He will have personal and regular access to JTFC.\n2. S\npokesman.   The spokesman will be the ‘face’ of the JTF to the\nmedia and will speak most often to them.  He should be carefully selected for\nhis skills in not just presentation but also in his ability to understand the wider\npolitical and legal dimensions of the JTF mission.  It is likely he will  be\ns\nelected personally by the Commander and be trusted by him.\n3. M\nedia Adviser .   JTFC’s are usually provided with a MOD appointed\nsenior media adviser.  He would work closely with the Media Ops staff an d\npr\novide that link to the Commander from the operational to the strategic level.\nHe would work closely with the Policy Adviser (POLAD) to do this.\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 6.5 Joint Media Operations Capabilities .   The main Media Ops capabilities are \nexplained below.  In addition to these, Media Ops will provide escorts to assist the media in \ngetting out, if the situation permits, to gather information for their reports.  \na. A Media  Information Centre ( MIC).   The MIC is the ‘Operational Media\nCentre’, that is responsible for the day -to-day contact between the JTFHQ and the\nmedia.  As such, the M IC is an area away from the main JTFHQ, it has no access to\nclassified material or direct access to key JTFHQ personnel.  However, the M IC mus t\nbe r\nun in such a way as to be welcoming to the media and be the source of\ninformation to the media.  It should provide facilities such as power and broadband,\nso the media can file their stories.\nb. M\nedia Production Team (MPT) .   The MPT works with the MIC to provi de\ni\nmagery, video and other products for use by the media and internally by the JTFHQ.\nThe JTF will be the only source of some imagery and video from specific high threatTF areas.  This will be collected by a Combat Camera Team, where the media do not\nhave access.  The MPT will ensure this activity is captured and the products provi\nded\nt\no the media.  Any MPT product made available the media has to be provided in the\nright format and in sufficient copies to provide the media with access; this is oft en\ndone el\nectronically.\nc. M\nedia Operations Team  (MOT).   Media operations teams are deployed at\nthe JTF HQ level and act as the primary interface between the commander and t he\nm\nedia.   Teams provide a broad range of media capabilities to plan, coordinate and\ndeliver JTF media activities.\nd. A\n Combat Camera Team (CCT) Capability .   The JTF will deploy with a\nnumber of CCTs who will collect imagery to support the JTF information activities.This imagery may be made available to the media , JTF units, and members of the\ncoalition or for use by coalition government departments.\ne. M\nonitoring and Analysis Team .   The Monitoring and Analysis team analys e\nm\nedia comment and output about the operation.  They will cover media based both\ninside and outside the JOA .  It will provide summaries of what is being reported, how\nand why, which contribute to situational awareness.  To conduct its role fully it will\nemploy linguists to assess local media.  Monitoring and Analysis is not a J2 function,\nit may contribute information into the intelligence cycle but does not provide J 2\na\nssessments.\n6.6 B\nasic Functions of Media Operations . \na. M\nedia Ops  plans.    The Media O ps plans function aims at planning Media\nOps capability activities in accordance with higher HQ direction and guidance ,\nr\neceived through the STRATCOM  planning process; production of planning inputs to\nthe operations planning process and decision- making process, which involves\nworking group and board participation; issuing guidance to lower -level military Medi a\nO\nps; synchronisation and integration of its own plans with whole HQ plans (through\nthe Info Ops processes).\nb. Media activities .   Media activities are information activities conducted by\nMedia Ops  that enable communication with a wide variety of audiences thr ough\nengagem\nent with the media. Commanders and staffs, through media ops , are\npr\nepared to respond to media queries, issue statements, conduct briefings  and\ni\nnterviews, arrange for media access to permanent and operational units,  and\nSERIAL 4-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 distribute information through the traditional media, as a means to develop relations \nwith the purveyors and consumers of news.  \nc. Media production .   The media production function supports the conduct of\ninternal and external communications and includes (but is not limited to) t he\npr\noduction of images, videos and written media ops  products (e.g., photos, liv e\nbr\noadcasts, posters, backgrounders, infographics).\nd. Digital media activities .   Digital media activities provide information directly\nto audiences through online and digital media channels.   Digital media must not\nsimply broadcast information, but foster engagement with all stakeholders involved,\nexisting supporters and broader potential audiences.\ne. Media monitoring and analysis .   Media monitoring and analysis provides\nearly warning and analysis of news, assesses the media environment to help prepare\ncommunications plans, and provides post- engagement feedback and evaluation.\nf. Internal communications.    Internal communications are a comm and\nr\nesponsibility and Media Ops  is the lead function responsible for supporting the chai n\nof\n command in executing it.  Internal communications inform the members of the JTF\nabout the command, its people and its activities, and are distinct from administrativ e\ni\nnformation.\n6.7 G\neneric planning model for  Media Operations .   The Media Ops staff will \ncontribute to the STRATCOM input into the joint estimate.  \n• Initiation .   Media Ops will contribute to the Information Environment Analysi s\n(\nIEA) starts during initiation.   Media Ops commence media monitoring and analysis\nand contribute to audience analysis.\n• Mission Analysis .  Conduct a media ops staff factor estimate.

A Press Release is issued when there is \nsomething newsworthy to communicate to the media; they are not issued for every activity \nthat occurs during an operation.  A Press Release is not just a product but a way of trying to \nachieve a specific communications objective or effect – you must decide on the effect to be \nachieved before writing the press release.  A well written press release serves not only as a source of information but also provides information to the media of operations and activities \nthat they may wish to cover in greater depth using their own resources.  Press releases \nshould:  \n•Arouse interest in the appropriate audience and appeal to them.  The use ofexaggeration for this purpose is not acceptable.\n•Each topic addressed in press releases should be placed in its proper context to t\nhe\ngr\neatest possible degree.\n•Be authorised and cleared by the chain of command before  being issued; especially\nif the subject is contentious or about a tragic incident.\n•Be sent to all media outlets, not just print media.\n•Be written in a manner that is readily understandable.  Technical terms shoul d be\nus\ned as little as possible and always be clarified.\n•Keep the main content of the Press Release on one page and the Background on t he\ns\necond page and no more.\n•Contain short sentences.\n•Accredit statements and directives by name or a military source, eg JTFC HQ Medi a\nCe\nll.\n•Not be classified, as Press Releases are distributed to the public/press.\n•Be Word Documents and not pdfs – the press will want to use the text and can’t\neasily cut and paste from a pdf.\n•Don’t u se dashes as internet searches don’t recognise dashes !\n•Must answer the following questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How and HowMuch – the 5Ws and 2Hs\n2:\nT\nhe 5Ws and 2Hs:  \nWHO?  •Full details of person or group spelled out: rank, first name(s), last\nname(s)\n•Full details of unit spelled out\nWHAT?  •Explain succinctly what happened/is being announced\n•Do not discuss exact numbers or troop strength (use descriptions\nlike ‘Light’, ‘Heavy’ or ‘Moderate’).\nWHEN?  •Day and month\n•You don’t need the calendar year if the event/announcement is i n\nthe same year\nWHERE?  •Exact location keeping in mind operational security issues if that is\na factor\nWHY?  •Explain the significance of the news event\n•If there are operational security considerations that precl ude\nreleasing this information, say so\nHOW?  •How did an incident happen?\n•If there are operational security considerations that precl ude\nreleasing this information, say so\n1 The word ‘Press’ is used in this context as a proper noun.

They assist the spokesman by keeping him \non track during an interview, press conference etc.  They should provide information about \nthe subject of the interview or press conference.  Talking Points should also provide the spokesman with links to the wider themes and messages appropriate to the time of the \ninterview or press conference.  They often incorporate sample questions and answers to \nfurther support the spokesman.  Spokesman may not be experienced Media Ops staff \nofficers in the JTFHQ, they may be officers or soldiers within units in the JTF.  Talking Points \nshould be written with this in mind. Note:  \n•Tal\nking Points are for internal use and are never to be released to the media  or\nplaced on an open- source web page.  If the spokesman is talking to the media on the\ntopic of a recently issued press release, then the talking points should reflect whatwas issued in the press release and provide further detail.\n•Often at the start of a press conference, the lead spokesman has an opportunity tomake a statement, this will usually last between 3 -5 minutes before taking questions.\nThe talking points provide the key information that the spokesman needs to getacross in the statement.  The questions and answers provided support the\nspokesman in the press questions that follow the statement.\n•Talking Points can be read as  a script if the spokesman is unfamiliar with the topic, or\nif accuracy id required such as talking about a specific incident.   They are a series of\nbullet points or short paragraphs that the spokesman can refer to.  In a pressconference the spokesman may cover these in the order they are presented duri\nng\nhi\ns opening statement.  In an interview with a journalist, he may not get questions on\ntopics in the order they appear in the talking points.  This doesn’t matter as long asthe spokesman has the points to refer to, he can bring them into the conversation at\nthe appropriate time.\n•Further Guidance:\n•Talking Points should be clear and concise.\n•Use plain English and short sentences.•Background is used now instead of Notes for\nEditors\n•If used, this may be background material to the\nstory  \n•Links to key information sources about the storyare included\n•Always put contact details\n•The press can use these to follow up on the storyand confirm details\n•This does not have to be a named person\nAgain, put the published date at the bottom of the \npress release  ENDS signifies the end of the Press Release text  \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 8 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 •Must be factual and accurate.\n•Avoid technical terms or jargon.\n•Avoid humour – Talking Points might be used by more than one person or\nquoted\n•Put your key point as the first point; if there has been a Press Release on t he\nt\nopic reflect the lead point in the Press Release in your Talking Points.\n•Support your main point with further information, explanation or an example.\n•Address the specific topic but include wider messages and themes that ar e\nappr\nopriate.\n•Anticipate what the press will ask and incorporate this in your questions a nd\nans\nwer section.\n•Talking Points for good news will not take as long to write as talking points for\nsomething bad or controversial.\n•If writing Talking Points on a bad or controversial topic, be up front about it – it\nshould be your first point.  Think carefully about the questions and answers to\nsupport the spokesman appropriately.\n•Remember people think in three’s.\n6.10 Preparing for a Press Conference.  Use the following points as an aide memoire \nfor organising and conducting at press conference.  Remember that any information release to the press – information packs, videos, pictures etc must be cleared first and authorised for \nrelease:  \n• Is a press conference the most appropriate and effective way to deliver\nthe message? Is this announcement or occurrence of important news value?\n• Obtain appropriate approvals. The press conference should not come as\n a\ns\nurprise to the chain of command.\n• Consider national and international linkages and issues . Local issues\nmay have something in common with regional, national, and international issues.\n• Select the proper spokesman (men) . The principal spokesman should b e\nt\nhe most qualified and knowledgeable person available. The spokesman shoul d be\nt\nhoroughly briefed using relevant talking points and Q&As and a rehearsal\nconducted.  Likewise prepare appropriate Subject Matter Experts if they are to speak.• Select the proper venue. Choose a location large enough to accommodat\ne\nt\nhe numbers of journalists that are expected.  Confirm adequate electrical power is\navailable to accommodate television lights and that an internet connection, VTC\nand/or satellite connection are available as  required.  Make sure the location is easily\naccessible, and that media representatives do not have to carry heavy equipment\nlong distances.  Be sure the room is well- ventilated in summer and well heated i n\nwin\nter.\n• Send out invitations .  Send out a Media Advisory inviting the press to the\npress conference, about four or five days before the press conference, unless  a\npr\ness conference is called at short notice following an incident or because of\nbreaking news.  Follow up the day before w ith an email to media, editors, or news\ndirectors.  A fter the event, post a copy of the information pack you prepared for t he\nev\nent online for those in the media who could not attend.   This demonstrates interest\non your part, and it may help you get a better turnout at future press conferences.\n• Prepare information packs and hand -outs carefully.  Information packs\nare valuable aids because they allow the officer conducting the press conference t o\nr\nefer to the pack for technical questions or statistical details.  The person giving t he\nnew\ns conference must be completely familiar with the contents of the pack, since\ncredibility can suffer if that person mistakenly refers to information not included in t he\npac\nk.  Distribute the information packs before the press  conference starts.\n• Have a moderator . The moderator is the first person who will speak to the\npress at the conference.  He introduces the press conference, explains the gr ound\nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 9 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 rules, and he introduces the spokesman.  He may coordinate the questions from the \npress or this may fall to a press conference chairman.  He must speak to the \nspokesman before the press conference to confirm the key messages and conduct a \nrehearsal.  The r oles of the press conference moderator are at below.  \n• Select visual aids and products carefully . If visual aids are used to support \na press conference you must make those videos/pictures available to the press.  \nBecause of its access, the military can often provide videos and pictures that the \nmedia cannot get themselves.  Make sure the press repres entatives know from the \noutset which visual products will be available.  For example, television reporters will \nexpect copies of video recordings, and print journalists will want photographs, copies \nof charts, stati stics and overheads.  If copies are not immediately available, you \nshould say so, but be prepared to provide them later.  \n• Press Conference Layout -  Accommodate all media . Within Media Ops \nthere will be a team that set up and layout each press conference.  There will be standard layout which should be used –  see layout diagram below.  Television \nreporters are the most challenging to accommodate.  From a visual perspective,  the \ntable or lectern for the spokesperson participating in the press conference should be the focus of the event, at the front of the room, ideally on a slightly raised platform.  \nThere should be a large cent ral aisle to permit camera operators to shoot straight on.  \nAlternatively, you should provide cameramen a raised platform at the back of the room to permit filming over the heads of other participants and media \nrepresentatives.  In an outdoor setting, you can mark off a semicircle facing the spokesperson, to allow the press conference participants and the media \nrepresentatives to arrange themselves according to their requirements.  Television \nreporters usually want to maintain eye contact with their camera operators, and radio \nreporters generally prefer to sit near the front of the room, so they can adjust sound levels. Generally speaking, print journalists can sit anywhere.  From a technical point \nof view, you should make sure that appropriate audio- feed facilities are available for \nall journalists who want to record the press conference.  \n• Anticipate Frequent Movement . There will be frequent movement during the \npress conference.  Movement is a feature of press conferences which is often \nunexpected by those taking part for the first time.  Radio reporters move about to \nchange or adjust recording device sound levels, tel evision -camera operators wander \naround looking for interesting angles, and photographers move back and forth to \nobtain a variety of pictures. Be prepared for movement, and brief the person giving \nthe press conference accordingly . \n• Time the Press Conference well .   The timing of the press conference will \ndepend on the key audiences you are attempting to reach and the news cycle where \nthose audiences live. If the intended audiences are western ones, then ideally, press \nconferences should take place between 10:00 and 11:30 am in western times zones.  \nThis allows members of the press to be allocated to the cover the press conference \nand to prepare.  It also allows media editors to feature the material from the press \nconference on noon newscasts and in afternoon and early -evening editions.  Press \nconferences in the afternoon run the risk of being overtaken by fast -breaking stories.  \nIn scheduling the date and time for the press conference, consider the competition \nfrom other scheduled events in the area.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 10 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025  \n \n \n \n \n \n6.\n11 Press Conference  Moderator’s Roles.  The press conference moderator will be the \nfirst person to speak at a press conference and as such is a key role.  He will only speak for \n2-3 minutes but what and how he speaks will set the tone for the rest of the press\nconference.  His preparation prior to the press conference will be key to success. The\nm\noderator needs to gain the confidence of the room and ensure the press know what is\ngoing to happen, how it will happen, who will be speaking to them and how long they havegot.  The moderator should cover the following:\nSer \n(a) Activity  \n(b) \nBEFORE THE PRESS CONFERENCE  \n1 Confirm with the organisers of the press conference:  \n•Loc\nation of the press conference\n•Room layout and equipment\n•The information to be provided to the press in the form of informati on\np\nacks/kits\n•Who has been invited and who has accepted invitations\n2 Meet with the spokesman to confirm:  \n•The pr\ness conference details and purpos e\n•Which press are attendingBackground  / \nVisual Aids  \nPress Seating  \nRaised area for \nCameras Crews  Spokesman/men  \nEntrance/Exit  \nX \nX Moderator  \nFlag covered  \nTable or \nEquivalent  Spokesman/men  \nMedia Entrance/Exit  Limit of Media  \nForward Movement  \nFigure 6. 1 \nExample Press \nConference \nLayout  \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 11 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Ser \n(a) Activity  \n(b) \n•The main messages to be communicated\n•Conduct a rehearsal\nAT THE PRESS CONFERENCE 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE START  \n3 Welcome the Press to the Press Conference  \n4 The moderator introduces himself  \n5 Explain who the spokesman (men) and chairman will be \n6 State the start time and finish time of the press conference  \n7 Explain that the running order for the Press Conference:  \n•I\nntroduction of spokesman (men)\n•Spokesman (men) will deliver prepared statements\n•Press will be invited to ask questions:\noS\ntate the number of questions that will be taken\noConfirm who will select questions – moderator or chairman\noOpportunity for one question and a supplementary question if time\npermits\n•The c\nall for ‘Last Question, please’ will be the last question\n•Explain the content of any information packs that are issued to the press\n•Confirm how the press can access information, images, videos etc\n(usually via a web page)\n8 You will provide the press with a one -minute warning before the start of the press \nconference  \n9 Spokesman (men) enter the room and take their seats  \n1 MINUTE BEFORE THE PRESS CONFERENCE STARTS  \n10 Announce to the press that the conference will start in one minute  \n11 Remind press to silence phones and IT  \n12 At the allotted time:  \n•I\nntroduce the spokesman (men) and the chairman\n•Confirm that there will be statements made by the spokesman (men)\n•That questions will then follow, and the moderator/chairman will select\nquestions\n13 Spokesman (men) read prepared statements  \n14 The Spokesman (men) are now ready to take your questions  \n15 Moderator/Chairman selects a member of the press whose hand is up:  \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 12 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 Ser \n(a) Activity  \n(b) \n•The member of the press will usually say who they are and which medi a\norganisation they are representing\n•They will then ask their question – the moderator/chairman must ensure it\nis just one questi on\n•The S\npokesman (men) answers the question\n•Offer the member of the press to ask a supplementary question – if time\npermits\n•Move on to next question\n16 Moderator/Chairman announce the last question:  \n•“I see we’re nearly out of time.

The Spokesman (men) will be the focal point of any press \nconference.  Commanders at all levels should expect to be spokesman at some point and \nshould seize the opportunity to communicate with the press.  For routine matters, a military \ncommand may have a designated spokesman, whose primary role is to talk to the press.    \n6.13 Preparing the Spokesman Pre -Interview/Press Conference .  A member of the \nmedia ops team should meet with the spokesman prior to the interview/press conference:  \n• Explain the role of media ops.\n• Explain the purpose of the interview/press conference.\n• Cover attendees.\n• Cover the location of the interview/press conference.\n• Review ground rules.\n• Time limits.\n• Review talking points and Q+A.\n• Who are the key audiences?\n• The moderator should also speak to the spokesman and go through t he\nr\nunning order of the press conference\n• Rehearse!\n6.14 Spokesman Presence, Focus and Clarity.

Spokesmen must always remember the main messages \nand themes and try to work them into their answers by ‘bridging’ from the specific answer to \nthe broader message.  They should think of ‘soundbites’ –  short phrases which summarise \nthe key message.  \n \n• Bridging .   Bridging allows the spokesman to turn the question to his agenda.  \nSpokesman need to present their message and then support it.  If asked about a \nproblem – present a solution.  \no How?  Answer the question briefly or block the question (see blocking below).   \n‘Bridge’ to your key message by using a transitional phrase:  \no A: “what I can tell you”  “what you should consider”  “what’s important to \nrealise”  \n• Blocking.   Allows the spokesman to avoid the question.  Never say no comment and only block when there is good reason to do so.  If you cannot answer, say why, \nfor operational security reasons.  Then bridge to your key message.  \no How?  \nQ. Do you think the UN/Gold Alliance should authorise an attack?  \nA: “That’s a question for our political leadership [BLOCK]; what I tell you is \n[BRIDGE] that soldiers under my command are trained and ready to perform \nany mission they are called on to do [KEY MESSAGE].”  \n6.17 A Guide to Radio Interviews:  \n• Describe.  Radio listeners can’t see you so try to describe what it is you are \ntalking about –  paint a picture.  \n• Detail .  As you are trying to paint a picture, more detail is required than with a \nTV interview.  \n• Use your voice.  Be enthusiastic and use different tones of your voice to add \nto the atmosphere of the interview.  \n• Notes.  Write down any key points but do not use a script or have pre-\nprepared sentences.  They will sound unnatural.  \n• Don’t fiddle.  External noise can be distracting especially when there are no \nvisuals.  \n• Sound effects.  The  interviewer may wish to record background sounds.  \n6.18 Analysing a Press Conference and Conducting a n After -Action Review  \n• Role .  The media ops monitoring and analysis staff officers are responsible \nfor analysing any media activity, assessing its subsequent impact and recommending \nwhat, if anything, needs to happen in response to the media.  In order to do this \nanalysis staff officers  need to be involved at every stage of the interview/press \nconference.  They need to have all the relevant paperwork and be present during the preparation and rehearsal stages of the interview/press conference.  They need to \nattend the interview/press confe rence and monitor what was asked and what was \nsaid.  Finally, they must conduct the after -action review to assess from all \nparticipants if messages were communicated effectively and then make \nrecommendations of a way forward.  \nSERIAL 04-02-06 \n4–02–06 - 15 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 6 – May 2025 • Preparation.   Media Ops analysis staff should have all the relevant\npaperwork relating to the interview/press conference:  press releases, spokesman’s\ntalking points etc.  They should attend the spokesman’s pre -briefing and th e\nr\nehearsal.  They must understand the purpose of the interview/press conferenc e and\nw\nhat key messages are going to be communicated.  They should also understand\nwhich press are attending and what ‘agendas’ the press may have.  Set a time wit h\nal\nl staff involved for the after -action r eview.\n• At the Interview/Press Conference.   Media Ops analysis staff attend th e\ni\nnterview/press conference to monitor what questions were asked and what answers\nwere given in response.   These can be recorded electronically.  The mood of theinterview/press conference must be judged, as should how the responses t\no\nques\ntions were received.\n• After Action Review .   The Media Ops analysis staff conduct the after -action\nr\neview.  The staff may need a period of time to analyse the recording of t he\ni\nnterview/press conference to get the full benefit from the process.  The after -action\nr\neview should be run as a focussed discussion and draw on the experience of all w ho\nat\ntended the interview/press conference.  A suggested sequence:\n• Start with purpose of the after -action review to understand whether t he\nk\ney messages were communicated and what actions need to follow.\n• State the key messages that the spokesman wanted to communicate\n• Identify which messages were communicated and how successfully.\nTo which questions etc.\n• Highlight difficult questions and how these were dealt with.\n• Is there a need to follow -up with certain members of the press t o\nc\nlarify anything?\n• Any immediate messaging implications for the next interview/press\nconference? (It may be that certain messages that were covered need to be\nam\nended or messages need to be reinforced).\nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 OPERATIONS SECURITY  (OPSEC)  & DECEPTION  FUNDAMENTALS  \nThis summary is taken from AJP -3.10.2 (Ed A) Ver 2 March 2020  Doctrine for Operations \nSecurity & Deception. \n7.1. Introduction .  Surprise and security are two of the ten principles of war OPSEC and \ndeception support these principles .  It is critical that OPSEC and deception planning is taken \ninto account from the outset of the planning process at the strategic, operational and tactical \nlevels  of command.  \nOperations Security (OPSEC ).  \n7.2. OPSEC Definition.  OPSEC is defined as: ‘ the process that gives a military \noperation or exercise appropriate security, using passive or active means, to deny an \nadversary knowledge of the essential elements of friendly information, or indicators of them’ .  \n(AJP-3.10.2)  \n7.3. OPSEC Aim.  The aim of OPSEC is to deny critical information and indicators to \nadversaries.  \n7.4. Essential element of friendly information (EEFI) .  An EEFI is defined as: ‘ critical \ninformation about intentions, requirements, capabilities and vulnerabilities that, if compromised, could threaten the success of operations .’   \n7.5. OPSEC  Security Process.   OPSEC is more than a collection of specific rules and \ninstructions.  As a cyclical process, it should be applied to any operation or activity to deny \nEEFI to adversaries.  It is conducted in a five -step process that is continuous across all \nphases of operations, including post conflict.  It is not linear but is a continuous cycle, as \nillustrated in Figure 7 .1, and outlined below, with the need to continually identify EEFI and \nindicators as the central requirement . \n1\n.I\ndentify EEFI and indicators.  The\nOPSEC process must establish the context\nof the risk. The OPSEC staff must ensur e\nt\nhat EEFI and indicators specific to the plan,\noperation or activity are captured from th e\nr\nelevant staff.\n2.R\nisk assessment .  OPSEC assessment s\nar\ne the responsibility of OPSEC- trained staff,\nalthough they will require supporti ng\ni\nnformation from other staff.  The OPSEC\nstaff must work closely with the intelligenc e\ns\ntaff to identify the risk, analyse the risk  and\nev\naluate the risk .\n3:  Apply OPSEC measures. Once the \ncommander has selected the COA, the OPSEC \nstaff should identify the relevant OPSEC \nmeasures required to treat risks and finalize the plan to enforce them. \n4:  Monitor and review effectiveness of OPSEC measures. The OPSEC staff must \nevaluate the risk treatment provided by the OPSEC process. This should be a planned \npart of the process and must allow for continuous monitoring and review.  \n5:  Communicate and consult at all stages. The OPSEC staff must ensure the \nvalidated EEFI list is promulgated to all staff.  Communication and consultation with \ncommanders and staff should take place during all stages of the OPSEC process. OPSEC must be coordinated with all staff branches to ensure feedback on the \neffectiveness of OPSEC and be executed across the joint force.  \nFigure 7.1   The OPSEC Process  \nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 7.6. OPSEC Measures.  The following table of OPSEC measures is a guide only.   \nDevelopment of specific OPSEC measures is as varied as the specific vulnerabilities they \noffset.   Measures can be broken down into operations and logistics measures, technical \nmeasures and administrative measures . \nOperations & Logistics \nMeasures  Technical Measures  Administrative Measures \nRandomize the performance of \nfunctions and execution of \nmissions. Avoid repetitive or stereotyped tactics, techniques and procedures for executing \noperations.  Improve resilience to \ncyberattacks, implementing appropriate risk mitigation measures based on the results of cyber intelligence  Limit unsecure telephone \ncommunications . \nA\nvoid routine notices that \nreveal timings for events . \nEmploy force dispositions and \ncommand and control arrangements that conceal the \nlocation, identity and command \nrelationships of major units.  Prepare for electronic attack by \nensuring that appropriate electronic protective measures are in place.  Ensure that personnel are \naware of OPSEC vulnerabilities presented by \nonline social networking and \nuse of smartphones and other smart devices when  posting \ninformation about changes in personal or unit routines that \ncould indicate operations \nplanning or other details . \nConduct support activities in a \nway that will not reveal intensification of preparations before initiating operations.  Limit unsecure email \nmessages to non- military \nactivities and do not provide operational information.  Conceal budgetary \ntransactions,  supply requests \nand arrangements for services that reveal preparations for activity  \nTransport supplies and \npersonnel to combat units in a way that conceals the location and identity of the combat units.  Use encryption to protect \nvoice, data and video communications  Conceal the issue of orders, \nthe movement of specially qualified personnel to units, and the installation of special capabilities  \nOperate aircraft at low altitude \nto avoid radar detection  Maximize terrain masking  Control waste disposal or other \nhousekeeping functions  \nMinimize the reflective \nsurfaces that units or weapon \nsystems present to radars and \nsonars  Use screen jamming, \ncamouflage, smoke, \nbackground noise, added \nsources of heat or light, paint or weather conditions to mask activity  Follow normal leave and \nadministrative patterns to the \nmaximum extent possible prior \nto starting operations  \nDuring hostilities, use physical \ndestruction and electronic \nattack against the adversary’s \nability to collect and process information.  Deactivation of flight tracking \ndevices in the air domain and \nautomatic identification \nsystems in the maritime domain.  Ensure that personnel \ndiscreetly prepare for their families’ welfare. \nUse darkness to mask \ndeployments or force generation  OPSEC training provided to all \npersonnel involved in the operation or activity  \nProvide family OPSEC briefs to \ninform family members of the need for OPSEC.  \nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Deception  \n7.7. Overview .  Although OPSEC and deception are mutually supportive they are \nseparate  processes.   Deception at the operational level misleads an adversary about the \njoint task force commander’s (J TFC’s) conduct of operations in their joint operations area, to \npreserve freedom of action within the medium to short term .   \n• Deception explicitly targets the decision- maker critical to creating the requir ed\nbehav\nioural response.  The decision- maker may be at any level in any environment\nand may be indirectly targeted by influencing groups or sensors .\n• Operational -level deception may support a strategic deception plan.\n• Operational -level deception may require coordination with the strategic\nheadquarters and other government departments and may require approval of t he\ns\ntrategic commander.\n• Operational -level deception will also direct deception plans down to the tactical\nlevel and the component commanders, as tactical action can have strategic effects\nand consequences .\n• Deception is planned centrally;  it maintains operations security (OPSEC) a nd\nc\nontinuity from the strategic to the tactical level. It should unfold logically  and\nr\nealistically, feeding the adversary with the combat indicators they would expect to\nsee, yet not so obviously as to raise sus picion.\n• Adversarial intelligence must have enough time to collect and interpret fals e\ni\nnformation, but not sufficient time to conduct too thorough an analysis .\n7.8. Deception Definition.  Deception is: ‘deliberate measures to mislead targeted \ndecision-makers into behaving in a manner advantageous to the commander’s \nobjectives .’ (AJP-3.10.2)  \n7.9. Legal .  Provided it is not treacherous or otherwise prohibited by law or policy, \ndeception is a legitimate military activity and is a ruse of war. In an armed conflict, \ndeception must comply with the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) .  The use of deception \nmight be subject to other legal or policy limitations, including rules of engagement.  \n7.10.  Achieving a behavioural response . Deception is a psychological process and \nseeks a behavioural response, be it action or inaction. For the purposes of this SOHB Serial , \na behavioural response is a cognitive reaction to a stimulus that then provokes a decision to \nact or remain inactive.  \n7.11.  When can I  conduct deception?   Consider deception if favourable conditions for its \nsuccessful execution exist and it is likely to provide significant advantage.   These include:  \n• the adversary has an advantage that cannot be overcome without usi ng\ndec\neption – force strengths, capability, agility or situational awareness .\n• the adversary has known preconceptions that can be exploited .\n• the adversary has known flaws in their decision- making process .\n• the adversary is under pressure to act .\n• deception will enhance OPSEC .\n• deception will enhance the effectiveness of a conventional approach .\n• a target can only be influenced indirectly.\n7.12.  The Risk of Deception .  Deception should be considered a high -risk activity if: \n• Appropriate conditions to conduct deception do not exist;\n• The target has a record of detecting deception;\n• The understand process is incomplete or inconclusive – the target’s likely\nbehaviour in relation to the use of deception cannot be anticipated with any accuracy .\nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 4 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Insufficient knowledge exists of the adversary command and control  and\ni\nntelligence capability; and/or\n• The adversary becomes aware that they are being deceived then the plan may\nnot only fail but it could lead to adverse consequences by encouraging detailed re-\nevaluation of friendly forces COA.\n7.\n13. The Deception Process :  Deception is as much about thinking as it is about \nexecuting and needs to be a creative process. The six -step deception process below \noutlines the required approach to enable deception at the joint level . \n7.\n14. Structure of Deception.  The skeleton deception plan will outline four basic \nelements for each COA:  \n• Objective ; The J TFC’s planning guidance should provide deception goals and\nobj\nectives, which may be different for each COA.  The deception objective is a concis e\ns\ntatement of what the commander wishes the adversary to do, or not to do, and how it\nwill contribute to successful completion of the mission. This will provide the decepti on\npl\nanner with a clear aim. The objective is expressed as a positive result, such as\n‘deception will ensure the adversary does not commit its reserve due to the belief that\nthey are threatened fr om another flank/direction’. The target, story and plan are\nvariable and manipulated to form different approaches to achieve the objective.\n• Target ; The target decision- maker(s) identified during the understanding phas e\nbec\nomes the focus of the story and the plan.  This is because they can change the\nbehaviour of the adversary to meet the deception objective.  Knowledge of the target\ndecision- maker’s traits: speed of decision- making; clarity of information required befor e\ni\nssuing orders; willingness to accept risk; and which collection assets they most trust\nshould be taken into account as part of the target selection process.• Story;  Develop a story that will convince the target to behave in the desired way\nusing the deception techniques.   Seek to reduce the adversarial collecti\non and\nanal\nytical capability to detect the deception and thus reduce their chance of maki ng\nt\nhe true sense of what is happening.1•Commander's Initial Guidance\n•The Commander should articulate the deceptionintent in terms of the behavioural\noutcomes (what do you want the enemy to do?) providing a clear aim and focus forthe deception\n2•Understanding (The deception estimate)\n•Identify adversary decision makers and their predispositions (what values and beliefscan be exploited?)\n3•COA Development.\n•Each deception COA should have; the objective of the deception; the story; the target;and the plan. \n4•Commander's Selection of Deception COA\n•Development of deception plan; with a persuasive and believable story;  an\nas\nsessment plan; and  resource, coordination and synchronisation requirements.\n5•Commander's Approval of Deception Objectives.\n•Execute and monitor deception plan. Synchronise activity. Is the plan worki ng?\nD\noes the paln need to be modified? Do we need to terminate the plan?\n6•Assessment.\n•Was the behaviour objective achieved? Identify lesons and insights.\nFigure 7.2   The 6 Step Deception Process  \nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 5 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 • Plan.  The plan will detail the deception and the resources required to execut e\nand m\nonitor the adversary’s reaction to it.   Activities should be sequenced to maximiz e\nt\nhe portrayal of the deception story for the required period.  Identify the timelines\nrequired to deliver the activity, for the target to evaluate it and subsequently act upon\nit.  The time available for planning will affect what is  achievable.\n7.15.  Deception Planning .  The deception plan supports the operation plan (OPLAN). It is \nnested and integrated within the OPLAN to achieve coherence, yet it forms a separate  and \noften compartmentalized area of planning effort.  Deception planning happens parallel to all \nstages of the planning process. It contributes to the understanding generated in the initiation, it takes its direction from mission analysis and a skeleton deception plan supports COA \nanalysis, validation and comparison. After COA selection, the deception plan itself (the plan \nwithin the plan) is further developed.   Figure 7.3 illustrates this relationship . \n7.16.  Deception must be credible, consistent, verifiable, and executable . If a \ndeception plan is to be believable, the deception story must be:  \n• Credible in their minds - is it believable?\n• Consistent with the narrative of the operation and the strategic communications\nframework - does it make sense in the context with what is happening?\n• Verifiable by their collection assets in the time required - can it be confirmed?\n• Verifiable by friendly forces collection assets - can we confirm the opponent’s\nreaction?\n• Executable in terms of the actions that need to be conducted over the time\navailable to do so - can we do this in a timely manner?\n \nFigure 7.3   The Relationship between operations planning and the 6 Step Deception Process  \n\nSERIAL 04-02-07 \n4–02–07 - 6 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 7.\n17. Deception Techniques .  Consider the following deception techniques, to assist in \ndeveloping the deception plan. \n• The obvious solution . Reinforce the impression of taking an obvious or\nexpected approach to achieving the objective, whilst actually taking a different cours e\nof\n action (COA). This approach links with the false routine.\n• The false routine . Condition the target by repetition to believe you are pursui ng\nan appar\nently standard routine, whilst in fact preparing a quite different COA. This\napproach links with the obvious solution.\n• The substitution . Lead the target to believe nothing has changed by covertly\nsubstituting the false for the real, and vice versa.• The lure . Present the target with what appears to be a sudden or ideal\nopportunity they must exploit, whilst in fact luring them into a trap. This approach links\nwith the deliberate leak.\n• The deliberate leak. Deliberately disseminate information via agents, or other\nclandestine links, in such a way the target audience believes they have obtai\nned a\npi\nece of vital intelligence through skilful intelligence work. This approach links with t he\nl\nure.\n• The mistake . Lead the target to believe valuable information has come into their\npossession by mistake, through a breach of security, negligence or inefficiency. This\napproach links with the piece of bad luck.\n• The piece of bad luck. Convince the target they have acquired information of\nvital importance by accident, because of a train of circumstances over which friendly\nforces had no control. This approach links with the mistake.\n7.18.  Deception maxims. The following maxims also apply.  \n• Magruder’s principle .  It is generally easier to induce a deception target t o\nm\naintain a pre -existing belief than to deceive the deception target into changing that\nbelief.\n• Jones’ Dilemma .  Deception becomes more difficult as the number of sources\navailable to the deception target with which to confirm the real situation increases.\nHowever, the greater the number of sources that are deceptively manipulated, the\ngreater the chances the deception will be believed. Confirmation of the deceptiv e\ni\nnformation by a number of credible sources can help to reinforce the deception.\n• The inability to process small change in indicators over time. Decepti on\nt\nargets have proven vulnerable to not detecting small changes in essential elements of\nfriendly information (EEFI) and indicators, even if the cumulative change over time islarge.\n• Ambiguity enhancing or ambiguity reducing . Ambiguity enhancing decepti\non\nc\nauses the targeted decision- maker to become increasingly uncertain of the situation.\nAmbiguity reducing deception causes the targeted decision- maker to become certain,\ndecisive and yet wrong.\nSERIAL 4-03-01 \n4–03–01 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2017  KLF ARMOURED VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS  \nSer Veh Weight \n(kg) MLC  Dimensions  (m) Maximum \nSustained \nRoad \nSpeed km /h Fuel \n(litres)  Range  (km) \nArmament  Ammo  Crew  Height  Length  Width  Road  Mixed  \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) (l) (m) (n) \n1.

Offensive Support (OS) incorporates capabilities which directly or indirectly \nenable manoeuvre units at the tactical and operational levels to achieve their \nmissions by the destruction or neutralisation  of an enemy’s ground forces, the defeat \nof his air and aviation platforms and exploitation of the electromagnetic spectrum. Principally achieved by Land component indirect fire systems and GBAD, supported by ISTAR, and enabled by full spectrum targeting and battlespace management, OS will also orchestrate Joint Fires from Army aviation assets and the Maritime and Air components.\n \nROLES OF ARTILLERY:  \n4.2. Find.   ‘Find’ is critical to the core roles because without it there is little for the integrator  \nto be able to Strike and Integrate.  \n4.3. Strike .  The main aim in Strike is to destroy, cause attrition to or neutralise the  enemy \nutilising OS systems as part of t he combined arms or deep battle . \n4.4. Protect .  The requirement to protect the force embraces a number of specialised \ncapabilities within the Artillery supported by other assets.  \n4.5. Integrate.   The Targeting Process should be the main focus of activity to integrate \neffects across the full spectrum. The purpose of the Integrate role is to ensure that the \ncapabilities available to support ground manoeuvre are  coordinated and  de-conflicted to \nensure they support the plan and that the risks of  fratricide are reduced.

The best effect s are achieved a heavy concentration of fire from a number of assets  at \nonce rather than fewer assets  firing more ammunition each.   \n4.9. Destruction:  renders a target permanently out of action, with >30% casualties or \nmateriel damage; requires large quantities of ammunition, unless precision or Term inally \nGuided Munitions are used.  \n4.10.  Neutralisation: temporarily stops the enemy carrying out its  intended task and can last \nfor several hours after the lifting of the fire;  implies 10% casualties or materiel damage.  \n4.11.  Suppression:  limits the ability of the enemy to carry out its  task whist the fire \ncontinues . \n4.12.  Harassment : disturbs the rest of enemy troops, curtails movement and, by threat \nloses, lowers morale.  \n4.13.  Non-Lethal Effects : \na. Assists with Target Acquisition and / or Navigation.  \nb. Deception.  \nc. Psychological effects.  \nEMPLOYMENT OF OS IN SUPPORT OF OPERATIONS:  \n4.14.  OS strike assets may be used in the following ways depending on the tactical situation:  \na. Offensive Operations:  \n(1) Preparation Fire. Fire del ivered before an attack to weaken the enemy \nposition. This and  Counter -Preparation Fire are divided into:  \n(a) Close Supporting Fire . Fire placed on enemy  troops, weapons, or \npositions which, because of their  close proximity, present the most \nimmediate and serious  threat to the supported unit.  \n(b) Deep Supporting Fire. Fire directed on objectives  not in the \nimmediate vicinity of our forces, for neutralizing and destroying enemy \nreserves and weapons, and interfering with enemy command, supply,  \ncommunications and observations.  \n(2) Covering Fire . Fire used to protect troops when they are within range  of \nenemy small arms.  In amphibious usage, fire delivered prior to the landing to \ncover preparatory operations . \nb. Defensive Operations:  \n(1) Defensive Fire (DF). Fire delivered by supporting units to  assist and \nprotect a unit engaged in a defensive action.  \n(2) Final Protective Fire (FPF). An immediately available prearranged barrier \nof fire designed to impede enemy movement  across defensive lines or areas . \n(3) Counterpreparation Fire. Intensive pre- arranged fire delivered when the \nimminence of the enemy attack is  discovered.  \nc. Stabilisation Operations. OS has significant utility in its ability to directly \ninfluence an adversary’s behaviour through force posture as follows:  \n(1) Show of Force. The visible presence of a capability. This could for \nexample be guns parked up, driving about or deployed.  \nSERIAL 4-03-04 \n4–03–04 - 4 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 12  – May 2020 (2) Demonstration of Force. This could be the well -publicised firing of guns on \na range; the dropping of illumination rounds over a target to demonstrate the \nability to engage with lethal force.  \n(3) Use of Force. The actual use of force against an adversary.  \nd. Enabling Operations.  \n(1) Counter -Indirect Fire (C -IDF) / Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) . \nFire delivered for the purpose of destroying or neutralising indirect fire or Air \nDefence systems.  \n(2) Interdiction Fire. Fire placed on an area or point to prevent the enemy \nusing that area or point.  \n4.15.  Artillery / OS Tactical Tasks / Allocation.  \na. Direct Support .   NATO defines Direct Support (DS) as: ‘the support provided \nby a unit or formation not attached or under command/control of the supported unit or \nformation but required to give a priority to the support required by that unit or \nformation’ .  This has a wider meaning;  it implies the provision of the following to the \ndirectly supported formation or unit:  \n(1) A guarantee of fire.  \n(2) Observers, communications, liaison and advice.  This includes \nresponsibility for fire planning and the coordination of all offensive support at \nevery level of command from subunit upwards.  \nb. Reinforcing.   Reinforcing is a tactical task in which one artillery unit augments \nthe fire of another artillery unit.  NATO doctrine dictates that an artillery unit can \nreinforce only another artillery unit (including artillery Tac Gp) and not an all arms \nformation.  This relationship is a guarantee of fire to the artillery unit so reinforced. It is \nlikely to be accompanied by caveats on time and/or ammunition expenditure.  \nc. General Support .   General Support (GS) is that which is given to the supported \nforce as a whole and not to any particular subdivision of it.  It is often used to refer to \nartillery which is being used to influence the corps or divisional battle and is not generally available for the subordinate formations.  MLRS tasked with fighting the \ndivisional deep battle, is an example of such a tactical task.  There is no guarantee of \nfire in support of any other unit or formation.  \nd. General Support Reinforcing.   GS Reinforcing artillery supports the force as a \nwhole and, on a secondary basis, provides reinforcing fire for another artillery unit.  Thus, an artillery fire unit, given a tactical task of GS Reinforcing the artillery of \nanother unit or formation, c annot provide a guarantee of fire to it. It will respond to the \nother unit or formations requirements only if its own OS commander has no higher priority task for it at the time. Like reinforcing, the relationship is likely to be  \naccompanied by a time and/or ammunition expenditure caveat.  \nSERIAL 4-03-05 \n4–03–05 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 AIR MANOEUVRE & ATTACK HELICOPTER OVERVIEW  \n5.1. Introduction . The AH 64D /E Apache Attack Helicopter (AH) is the primary AH \ndeployed by UK, US and Ku forces. The Lynx/Wildcat is a Light U tility Helicopter (LUH) with \nthe capability to undertake tasks but without the firepower or protection of the AH.  The \npreferred engagement procedure for aviation is using a JTAC.  In such circumstances the \naircraft follows a similar sequence to that employed by fixed wing aircraft.  \nAttack Helicopter Characteristics  \n5.2. Capabilities . The AH has the following unique capabilities:  \na. Stand- Off Target Acquisition and Engagement . Capabilities of particular \naircraft vary with sensor and weapons carriage;  however,  they share the capability to \ndetect, recognise and engage man -sized targets and above up to 3000m using the \n30mm gun, with effective armour piercing up to 2200m.  When engaging \nautonomously with rockets and missiles the minimum range is 500m, extending to a \nmaximum of 6000m.  This range can be further extended to the weapon systems \nmaximum range of 8000m if the target is designated by a ground cal l sign or other \nthird party who is laser designator equipped.  A number of aircrew and all AAC pilots \nare trained to operate as A ir OPs for control and direction of artillery, mortars and NGS \nand/or as Airborne FACs.  Aviation platforms have the ability to assess a particular \nNamed Area of Interest (NAI) or potential Target Area of Interest (TAI) from different \naspects in order to provide the information required by a commander.  \nb. Rapid Deployment to the Target Area .  The high speed and flight capabilities \nof AH confer an ability to rapidly redeploy aircraft between firing points and \nengagement  areas and AH has the agility to quickly manoeuvre into observation \npositions that  would otherwise be difficult or impossible for ground troops to achieve.  \nc. Delivery Accuracy . Weapon systems of the AH are capable of precise  \nengagement of point targets, enabling weapons effects to be employed in close \nproximity to own troops or in circumstances where collateral damage must be limited.  \nAH is also capable of acquiring and designating targets for other joint fires assets to \nsubsequently engage.  \nd. Air Ground Communications .  Battlefield Helicopters can provide a  Command \nSupport capability to cover a range of tasks including provision of vital  communication \nlinks and communication through Rebroadcast (which will usually require line of sight) . \nAviation needs to be included in the communications plans at the earliest stage.  \ne. Massed Effects.  The long sensor and weapon ranges of the AH together with \nthe ability of the aircraft to rapidly deploy, allow weapon effects to be rapidly \nconcentrated from dispersed platforms.  \n5.3. Limitations .  The employment of AH is influenced by the following factors:  \na. Availability .  AH has a limited time on station which can be reduced by \ninclement  weather or when operating in hot and or high conditions.  Maintenance and \ncrew rest  requirements, together with transit distances to and from the forward \noperating bases  reduce the capability of AH to provide continuous coverage or \navailability.  When fitted  with 2 external tanks, AH can typically operate out to 250 km \nand loiter for 60  minutes, though the additional fuel weight will mean a weapon effect \ntrade off.  Poor  weather will affect sensor performance.  Protection must be considered \nincluding the selection of ingress and egress routes over uncleared terrain.  Aviation \ncan operate outside the land component battlespace and may be tasked by the joint \nforce HQ.  \nSERIAL 4-03-05 \n4–03–05 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 b. Weather and Visibility .  While AH is equipped with all- weather  sensors, target\nacquisition and engagement capability is reduced in poor weather.  Poor weather and\nvisibility may also reduce flight performance, or in extreme cases prevent AH\noperations.\nc. Vulnerability.  AH are equipped with passive and active defensive aids suites.\nHowever, they are still vulnerable to enemy ground based air defence systems andaircraft.  Low flying AH are particularly vulnerable to small arms and heavy machine\ngun fire and ideally should not operate over enemy locations or un -cleared terrain.\n5.4. Rotary Wing Close Air Support (RW CAS).  The AH is the best RW platform for \nproviding CAS, under the direction of a JTAC , as it can deliver a wide range of weapons \nand, due to its design, has high levels of self -protection.  The fires capabilities of armed \naviation will be maximised when integrated with other force elements including Offensive \nSupport and Ground Manoeuvre.  AH is particularly suited to close support operations  \nbecause of its ability to loiter in the area of operations coupled with the devas tatingly  \naccurate nature of its weapon systems.  For planning purposes,  it is treated in the same way \nas any other direct fire weapon system.  However,  the notion that AH can hover on  station in \nsupport of ground troops is only true where there is a benign air environment and  the enemy \nlacks effective Ground Based Air Defence (GB AD). \n5.5. KU Aviation .  2 x AH Squadrons  in the Air Force.  Each has of 8 x Apache.  \n5.6. Roles: \na. Combat :  attack, armed recce, guard .\nb. Comb at Support : ISTAR, direction of fire support, A irborne FAC, comma nd\ns\nupport, escort .\n5.7. Range and Endurance . As a rule of thumb, in a temperate climate below 2000’ above \nsea level, AH and LUH have approx 2 hrs flying before needing to refuel.  However, max \nweapon payloads will reduce this and the table bellows gives more detailed figures for AH . \nStrike Missions (20 mins TOT)  Manoeuvre Missions (e.g. Guard, delay, \netc) \nHellfire  Fuel Pods Range (km)  Hellfire  Fuel Pods  Endurance (hrs)  \n16 0 183 – 204 16 0 1.3 – 1.6 \n12 1 225 – 349 12 1 1.6 – 3.0 \n8 2 267 – 493 8 2 2.2 – 4.3 \n5.8.

In flat, open terrain, at max separation, 2 x AH can cover 16 km frontage.  \ne. AH ISTAR tasks may be reinforced by LUH to improve coverage and prevent \n‘seepage’ in closer terrain. This will not alter above time spans but may slightly \nimprove frontages.  \nf.

In order to  \nenable efficient battle procedure at the tactical level, commanders should ideally allow their \nsubordinates two- thirds of the time available between receiving their orders and their \nsubordinates commencing preliminary moves1.

The yardsticks in the abov e table are a guide only and must \nbe tailored to account for local factor s includin g dispersal , multi- nationalit y, comm s \ndifficulties,  speed of movement (affecte d by terrain, weather, threat, load, etc), the speed of \nthe enemy ’s actions and any r equirement to synch ronise phases of the execution with \nexter nal factor s such  as weather, hours of darknes s or inorgani c asse t availabilit y. Planning \ntime can be r educed by advanc e plannin g and briefing of options (eg CONPLANs ) or inten t \n(WngOs) . The movement  and r eorganisation component of battle procedure  can be \nreduced by: \n•Anticipation and preliminary moves.\n•Grouping to a common pattern (where possible within resource constraints).\n•Committing smaller groupings (accepting a reduction in combat power).\n•Securing and maintaining a greater number of routes to reduce congestion and\nal\nlow more direct transit (although this can be resource intensive).\n1.3.

A well- defined point on a route at which the movement of vehicles comes \nunder the control of the commander of the movement.  It is at this point that the column is \nformed by the elements comprising it, passing in succession at their appointed times.  In \naddition to the principal start point of a column, there may be secondary start points for its \ndifferent elements.  \n2.2. Column .  A group of vehicles moving under a single commander over the same route, in \nthe same direction, at the same time.  \n2.3. Element .  Subdivision of a large column, each element having its own commander.  \n2.4. Critical Point .  A selected point along a route used for reference in giving instructions. \nExamples are start points, release points and other points where interference with movement \nmay occur or where timings are critical.  \n2.5. Halts .  A short halt by columns or elements of columns travelling on controlled routes takes \nplace after 2 hrs running and lasts 15 mins.  If necessary, a second halt takes place after a further \n2 hrs and lasts for 30 minutes.  This pattern may be repeated up to a maximum of 9 hours actual \ndriving time, after which drivers should take a minimum of 11 hours unbroken rest before commencing driving again.  Where operationally essential, an extension to drivers’ hours may be \napplied for.  Whenever possible all columns following the same route should stop at the same \ntime, but movement planning must, where necessary, allow at least a 10 min column gap to \nensure a following column does not overtake the one in front whilst halted.  Should the \ncharacteristics of the road may make it necessary for columns to halt at a particular part of the route instead of all its vehicles halting at a fixed time, the movement order will specify when such \nhalts are to be taken.  There are no standard rules for long halts.  They may be ordered for rest \nperiods, meals and to enable changes in density to be effected.  \n2.6. \nRelease Point .  A well-defined point on a route at which the elements comprising a column \nreturn to the authority of their respective commanders, each one of the elements continuing its \nmovement towards its own appropriate destination.  \n2.7. Rate  of March .  The average number of kilometres to be travelled in a given period of time, \nincluding all ordered halts.  It is expressed as kilometres in the hour (kih).  \n2.8. Running Time .  The total time for which a single element is in transit. \n2.9. Average Speed .  The average distance travelled per hour calculated over the whole \njourney, excluding specifically ordered halts.  \n2.10. Pass Time .  The time that elapses between the moment when the leading vehicle of a \ncolumn passes a given point and the moment when the last vehicle passes the same point plus, where appropriate, a time gap.  \n2.11. \nTime  Gap. Within columns travelling under 1 movement number, a time gap is added to \nthe calculated pass time.  It represents the sum of the intervals between the columns and \nelements expressed in mins.  The following yardsticks are used:  \n• Motorways :  15 per cent of pass time.\n• Urban roads :  20 per cent of pass time.\n• Traffic De nsity:  The average number of vehicles that occupy one kilometre of road\nspace.\nSERIAL 4-04-02 \n4–04–02 - 2 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 12  – May 2020 FORMULAE – SPEED & FLOW  \n𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨  𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑺𝑺=𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑲𝑲)\n𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴) \n• Traffic Flow (veh/hr) = Av Speed (kph) X Density (veh/km)  \n𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑹𝑹  𝑫𝑫𝑴𝑴𝑻𝑻𝑨𝑨 (𝑲𝑲𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴)= 𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑲𝑲)\n𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑹𝑹𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑺𝑺𝑲𝑲 ) \n𝑺𝑺𝑨𝑨𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴  𝑫𝑫𝑴𝑴𝑻𝑻𝑨𝑨 (𝑲𝑲𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴)= 𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝑫𝑫𝑻𝑻𝑫𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑻𝑻 𝑫𝑫𝑵𝑵𝑲𝑲𝑵𝑵𝑫𝑫𝑹𝑹 𝑻𝑻𝑶𝑶 𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑻𝑻𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺\n𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 (𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑽𝑽/Km)  ×  SPEED (KPH) \n• Total Time  = Running time + Pass Time + Gaps + Time on Halts.  \nFORMULAE – CONVOYS & COLUMNS  \n𝑻𝑻𝑨𝑨𝑴𝑴𝑹𝑹𝑳𝑳𝑽𝑽 𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐 𝒄𝒄𝒐𝒐𝑴𝑴𝑨𝑨𝒐𝒐𝒄𝒄 (𝑲𝑲𝑻𝑻)= 𝑫𝑫𝑵𝑵𝑲𝑲𝑵𝑵𝑫𝑫𝑹𝑹 𝑻𝑻𝑶𝑶 𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑻𝑻𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺\n𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 \n𝑻𝑻𝑨𝑨𝑴𝑴𝑹𝑹𝑳𝑳𝑽𝑽 𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐 𝑫𝑫𝒐𝒐𝑪𝑪𝑹𝑹𝑻𝑻𝑴𝑴  = 𝑺𝑺𝑨𝑨𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺  𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺 ) ×  𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑺𝑺𝑲𝑲 )\n𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 \nFORMULAE EXAMPLE – MOTORWAY VEHICLE MOVE \n• Number of Vehicles:    150 \n• Average speed:     20 kph  \n• Density:      10 vpkm  \n• Distance:      100 km  \n• Halts:      1 x 20 min  \n• Time Gap:      Motorways: 15 % of pass time  \n𝑺𝑺𝑨𝑨𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴  𝑫𝑫𝑴𝑴𝑻𝑻𝑨𝑨 (𝑲𝑲𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴)= 𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝑫𝑫𝑻𝑻𝑫𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑻𝑻 𝑫𝑫𝑵𝑵𝑲𝑲𝑵𝑵𝑫𝑫𝑹𝑹 𝑻𝑻𝑶𝑶 𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑻𝑻𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺\n𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫 (𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑽𝑽/Km)  ×  SPEED (KPH) \n   𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟔𝟔\n𝟏𝟏𝟔𝟔 ×𝟐𝟐𝟔𝟔   = 𝟔𝟔 ×𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏\n𝟏𝟏 ×𝟐𝟐    =  45 m in \n \n𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑹𝑹  𝑫𝑫𝑴𝑴𝑻𝑻𝑨𝑨 (𝑲𝑲𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴)= 𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑲𝑲)\n𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫𝑹𝑹𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑫𝑫 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫  (𝑲𝑲𝑺𝑺𝑲𝑲 ) \n     𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝟏𝟏𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔\n𝟐𝟐𝟔𝟔    =  300 min  \nTime Gap (Mins)  = 𝑺𝑺𝑨𝑨𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺  𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑫𝑲𝑲𝑫𝑫  (𝟒𝟒𝟏𝟏 𝑻𝑻𝑴𝑴𝑴𝑴 )\n𝟏𝟏𝟔𝟔𝟔𝟔 ×𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏  =  6.75  = 6 min 45 sec  \nHalts (Mins)   =       =  20 mins  \nTOTAL TIME (Mins)  = Pass Time + Running Time + Gaps + Time on Halts =  \nTOTAL TIME (Mins)  =  45 + 300 + 6.75 + 20    =  371.75= 371 min 45 sec  \n       = 6 hours 11 min 45 sec  \n \n \nSERIAL 4-04-02 \n4–04–02 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 12 – May 2020 MOVEMENT PLANNIN G YARDSTICKS  \n2.12.

Introduction .  This section shows planning figures for rates of advance of friendly \nforces against a range of resistance and terrain.  These figures are derived from historical \nanalysis and are planning start points only.  In reality a myriad of factors will affect these \nfigures as soon as an operation begins.  \n3.2. Adjustment Criteria. The figures in the tables can be adjusted according to the \nfollowing factors:  \na. Degree of Resistance. This factor is selected using military judgement. It shoul d\nnot\n rely purely on numbers of like for like equipment.  As an example, an enemy with\naccess to small arms only, may sit in a 5:1 ratio.  If they have access to a lar ge\nnum\nber of IEDs, or when asymmetric or irregular tactics are employed this ratio may\nincrease in the enemy’s favour.\nb. Surprise .  Where the attacker achieves surprise, the figures should be multipli ed\nby\n the appropriate factor stated below.  The effects of surprise are considered to last\nfor 3 days, being reduced by one -third on day 2 and two- thirds on day 3.\n(1) 5 X for complete surprise (eg the 1944 German attack through The\nArdennes or 1973 Arab offensive);\n(2) 3 X for substantial surprise (eg the 1941 German invasion of Russia or\n1967 Israeli invasion of Sinai);(3) 1.3 X for minor surprise (eg 1944 Allied Normandy landings or 1971 India\nn\nat\ntack on Pakistan).\n3.3. Sustaining Rates of Adv. Advance is possible against a superior force, but cannot \nbe sustained with less than a 3:1 force ratio.  \n3.4. Environmental considerations .  Terrain is listed by type. For detailed planning in \nspecific environments (eg urban, desert), refer to doctrine on operating in Specific \nEnvironments.  \n3.5. Land Division and Brigade Rates of Adv . The following tables (see next 2 Pages) \nshow the planning rate of advance for a division and brigade against a range of degrees of \nresistance and terrain accessibility.

General .  Combined Arms Obstacle Integration ( CAOI ) is All Arms activity to \nintegrate direct and indirect fire, manoeuvre, engineer effort and ground to achieve the \nCommander’s  intent. CAOI must support  overall CONOPS and scheme of manoeuvre . CAOI \nplanning must consider the target  (the el ement of Enemy Force and its cap ability ), loc ation  \n(tied to own SoM) and specific obstacle effects required.   \n1.2. Obstacle Effects : \n• Disrupt .\no Breaks up enemy  formations ,\nr\neduces his tempo and encourages\npremature deployment of his\nassets, creates surprise, hides ow n\nM\nDA.\no Light density.\no Attacks at least half of en AA.\n• Turn .\no Diverts en towards ground, eg\nKA.\no Series of obs encourage\nbypassing.o Use successive obs, strong\nenough to discourage breaching;\nmedium density.\no Often used on flanks of KA.\n• Fix.\no Slows en in specified area, eg\nKA.\no Buys time to detect, acquire,\ntarget and destroy en throughout\ndepth of KA.\no Obs in depth across width of\nAA.o Indiv obs light and easily\nbreached.\n• Block.\no Complex medium and heavy\nobs to stop en along a specific AA.\no Closes exits from KA, denyi\nng\nby\npass.\no Obs must have significant\ndepth.\n1.3. Principles of Obs tacles . \n• Major obstacles  planned at t he\nhi\nghest level.  Detailed sighting confirmed by supported Commanders .\n• Obstacle plan must be considered early and be fully integrated into the overall\noperational design.\n\nSERIAL 4-05-01 \n4–05–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 • Artificial obs tacles  should be sited to complement and take adv antage of natural\nobstacles .\n• Obstacles  must contribute to offensive action.  Gaps should draw enemy  into KA.\n• All obs tacles  must be covered by observation and fire.\n1.4. Constraints.  Obstacles  are only effective when fully integrated into the plan and \nsited and controlled to limit enemy forces  scope for manoeuvre, without unduly inhibiting \nfriendly force  manoeuvre. The fol lowing  factors may constrain CAOI:  \n• Time (for planning, recce, fwd mov of materials and emplacement).\n• Materials (explosives, defensive stores, lack of dedicated engr lift cap).\n• Political, legal, ethical , ROE or other HN factors,  including the influence pl an and\nt\nolerance of collateral damage, may further constrain CAOI.\n1.5. Obstacle  Control Measures. \n• Com mand ers use obs tacle  control  measures to express their intent.\n• Centralised control ensures that obs tacles  conform to the overall com mand ’s\nintent.\n• Com mand ers may delegate authority  or impose restrictions.\n• Zones or belts (areas) should not cross unit boundaries .\n• Unlike zones or belts, groups define specific obstacle locations.\n• Zones, belts , groups and  lines are designated specific letters or numbers.\n• Groups or lines are defined at BG and below in order to integrate desired effect\ninto the fire plan.• Never hold engineers in reserve, but always list an engineer priority of effort.\n1.6. Related Terminology . The following terms are from AAP -6, NATO Glossary of \nTerms, relate  to obstacles, mines and minefields (unless an alternate source is shown in \nbrackets).

This summary is taken from AJP -3.14 Force Protection.  \n3.2. Definition of Force Protection . Measures and means to minimize  the vulnerability \nof personnel, facilities, equipment, materiel,  operations, and activities from threats and \nhazards in order to preserve freedom of action and operational effectiveness thereby  \ncontributing to mission success.  \n3.3. Force Protection Applicability . FP is a joint function and essential to all operations. \nNations have differing FP philosophies, policies, and priorities; however, the focus for FP is \nunited:  the protection of a national contingent itself plus supporting elements and enabling \nthe force  to conduct its mission unimpeded by the actions of an adversary.  In a multinational \nforce, differences should be reconciled, taking into consideration national caveats, and an overall combined joint FP policy should be established, along with appropriate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), to facilitate unity of effort and enhance FP measures.  \n3.4. Staff Lead for Force Protection:   The J- 3/J-5 staffs assist the operational \ncommander in the coordination and planning of FP measures, tasks, and activities.  \n3.5. Force Protection Principles.   \n• Measured Assessment of the Threat . A threat assessment (TA) based o\nn\nac\ncurate and timely all -source intelligence serves as the basis for the selection of t he\npr\noper security alert state and associated FP measures.\n• Risk Management .

Air Component Force Protection.  The delivery of air FP demands an \nunderstanding of the airbase and surrounding ground, air and cyberspace environments. \nThis operational \nsetting routinely \ncomprises a significant \nnumber of high- value \nassets operating in close proximity. An airbase will usually \nhave a large \nelectromagnetic \nsignature, significant \ncyber footprint, a diverse population \n(both military and \ncivilian) and large \nquantities  of volatile \nand fragile materiel \nwithin its boundaries. \nWithin this context, FP activities \nmust be coordinated with air \noperators, enablers, collocated units and adjacent ground holding units; any of which may be coalition partners. Conceptually this engagement space is known as the complex air ground environment (CAGE).  \n3.8. Air FP Measures.  The FP commander, embedded within the HQ of an airbase, is \nresponsible for the integration of all FP measures on the base and within the assigned \nground defence area (GDA). In accordance with NATO doctrine, air FP measures fall into \nfour broad categories underpinned by FP C2 and timely intelligence. \nFigure 3.2   The Complex Air Ground Environment\nFigure 3.3   Air FP Measures  \nSERIAL 4-05-04 \n4–05–04 - 1 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 11 – May 2017  COUNTER SURVEILLANCE – EMISSION CONTROL MEASURES - LAND \n4.1.

Introduction .  This guide is a summary of material from JDP 4- 00 Logistics for Joint \nOperations Ed 4 2015.   Detail on the Joint Force Logistic component roles, responsibilities \nand C2 is at Serial 1 -01-11. \n1.2. What is Logistics?  logistics comprises having materiel  or services:  \n•in the right quantity •in the right place\n•in the right condition •at the right time\n1.3. Definitions .  On a more formal basis, Defence uses the NATO definition of logistics : \n•Logistics:  Logistics is the science of planning and carrying out the movement  \nand maintenanc e of forces. In its most comprehensive sense, the aspects of military  \noperations  which deal with:\nodesign and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution,  \nmaintenance, recov ery and disposal of materiel;\notransport of personnel;\noacquisition or construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of  \nfacilities ;\noacquisition or furnishing of serv ices; and\nomedical and health service support\n• Combat Service Support. Combat Service Support (CSS) is the  \norganisational support provided to combat and combat s upport forces, primarily  in \nthe fields of administration and logistic s.\n• Sustainment. Sustainment is the actual business  of maintaining a force by  \nenhancing and prolonging its  capability and resilience. Sus tainment included  \nlogistics, administration and the organis ation and resources required to deliver  \nsustainability.\n• Sustainability. To s ustain a forc e is to generate the means by which fighting  \npower and freedom of action are maintained. \n1.\n4. Principles of Logistics: \n• authority •efficiency\n• primacy of operational requirements  • simplicity\n• coordination and cooperation •flexibility\n• assured provision •visibility\n• sufficiency\n1.5. Logistics Terminology : \n• Sustainability statement . The sustainability statement (SUSTAT) confirms the\noverall logistic resources required and provides the authority to release and commit\nfinance and materiel.   The SUSTAT would normally include:\noThe expected duration of an operation\noThe essential equipment and availability requirements\noThe level of demand and self -sustainment required;\noPredicted casualty rates for personnel and equipment .\noInformation on the destination climate, environment, topography and human\nfactors .\n• Daily Consumption Rate (DCR). The standard metric for use in UK\noperational planning purposes is the DCR. DCR is defined as a unit or quantity of\nsupplies estimated to be the average consumption within a 24 hr period at specified\nactivity. The specified activity is to  be one of the four Defence activity rates: high\nSERIAL 4-06-01 \n4–06–01 - 2 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 Intensity (HI), Medium Intensity (MI), Routine Intensity (RI) and In- Theatre Training \n(ITT).  \n• Days of Supply (DOS).  The DOS definition allows for the average day to be\nt\nied to  national rates and therefore is retained with its current definition for use i n\nN\nATO strategic  and stockpile planning.\n• Individual Metrics. At unit level, the terminology of choice will continue to be\ni\nndividual  metrics such as rounds and litres.\n• Levels of Intensity . The following levels of intensity are used for Log planning.\nThere is  no simple arithmetic relationship between the log requirements for each\nlevel.\noHigh Intensity (HI) . A period during an operation when specific FEs ar e\noper\nating at maximum rate or surge capacity. It may be a single period or\nconsist of a number of discrete, but linked periods and will normally be\ncharacterised by continuous contact with the enemy.\noModerate Intensity (MI) . A period during an operation when specific FEs\nare operating at a sustained rate. It will normally, but not always, be\ncharacterised by regular contact with an enemy. It may include transitional and\npr\neparatory phases for HI. This rate of activity may continue for an extend ed\nper\niod and is likely to require a long term sustainment plan.\noRoutine Intensity (RI) . A period during an operation when a Unit,\nFormation or FEs within a JOA is operating at a routine and steady state. Thisincludes patrolling, ISR activities, maintenance, unit level continuation traini\nng\nand t\nransition planning/ drawdown. It may also include occasional, localis ed\nc\nontact with an enemy.\noIn Theatre Training (ITT) . This includes Mission Rehearsal, Joint Fires\nIntegration, calibration of weapons and systems, field firing and wider collectiv e\nt\nraining.\n1.6. Supply \nClasses. In order to engender a \ncommon \nunderstanding \nbetween nations, \nallied stocks, stores and supplies are \nsplit according to \nthe NATO classes \nof supply. The \nNATO system has been split between \n5 classes (although \nthe US mil have \nadditional classes) \nthat give gr eater \ngranularity to \nmateriel sub-\ndivisions. A \ncomparison of \nsystems is shown \nright: \n\nSERIAL 4-06-01 \n4–06–01 - 3 \nO\nriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 5 – Apr 2024 1.7. Lanes in Meter s (LIMs) or Linear Metres.  The standard measurement of vehicle \nspace on ships is the linear  metre. There are two measures of linear metre, both use the \nsame three letter abbreviation (LIM). The military LIM is 2.8 m wide by 1 m long; the civilian \nLIM is 2.5 m wide by 1 m long.  \n1.\n8. Logistic Estimate .

MEDEVAC  - Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) is the process of moving any \nperson who is wounded, injured or ill under continuous medical supervision and care \nto or between medical treatment facilities.  MEDEVAC is subdivided into 3 further \ncategories:  \n(1) Forward MEDEVAC (Fwd MEDEVAC ) - the movement of casualties in a \ndesignated vehicle with medical escorts from point of injury to Deployed \nHospital Care (DHC).  \n(2) Tactical MEDEVAC (TACEVAC) -  is conducted from one medical \ntreatment facility to another within the area of operations. Patients will routinely \nhave been stabilized prior to evacuation.  \n(3) Strategic MEDEVAC (STRATEVAC)  - s to be conducted from intra -\ntheatre medical treatment facilities, to a medical treatment facility outside  \nthe area of operations (usually role 4)  \n3.2. 10 Min.1.2(2)+2 Hours Medical Timelines .

The term CPERS covers all individuals who are captured and held by UK Armed \nForces on operations overseas whether prisoners of war (POW), internees or detainees. \nIrrespective of the category, UK and international law requires that all CPERS must be \ntreated humanely.  JDP 1- 10 Captured Persons is the capstone UK doctrine publication for \nall CPERS activities.  \n4.2. Processing CPERS .  The flowchart shown here is as expected in a conventional \ntheatre of ops.  The aim is to have the minimum number of processing stages between the \nunit and the Detention \nFacility.  The \nunit is \nresponsible \nfor moving \nCPERS to \nthe \nCollecting \nPoint. \nCPERS \nshould then \nbe moved to \nthe \nDetention \nFacility with \nthe minimum \nof delay.  \n \nFigure 4. 1  CPERS Handling Flowchart  \nSERIAL 4-07-01 \n4–07–01 - 1 \n \nOriginal MAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 – May 2020  DEFENCE LINES OF DEVELOMENT (DL oD) \n1.1. Purpose.  The DLoD are intended to apply coherence to the evolution of Defence \ncapability, which is ultimately delivered by an appropriate balance of effort across all DLoD; if \nany DLoD is omitted from capability planning, it is unlikely that optimal, sustainable capability \nwill be realised through a particular project.  The DLoD provide a useful checklist of \nconsiderations and can be applied widely in support of capability and other military planning. \nIn addition to the 8 DLoD, ‘interoperability’ is included as an overarching factor that must be \nconsidered when any DLoD is being addressed.  \n1.2. Definitions .  The DLoD were defined to ensure commonality of use in the through -\nlife development, delivery and sustainment of Defence capability.  The following definitions \ndescribe how the DLoDs are intended to contribute to the realisation of capability.  They are \nnot listed in order of importance and have equal value.  While useful elsewhere, these \ndefinitions may not apply fully outside of that context and do not necessarily reflect NATO \ndefinitions of the wider terms.  \n \n\nSERIAL 4-07-02 \n4–07–02 - 1 \n \nMAJCSC SOHB Edition: 1 2 – May 2020 DESIGNATION OF DAYS AND HOURS  \n2.1.

The Gold Alliance is a formal alliance of 6 states which all border the Arabian Gulf.  They \nare: \nAl Salaam  (SA) or (SAL)1 \nAl Noor  (NO) or (NOR)  \nMurjan  (MU) or (MUJ)  \nAl Qrain  (QR) or (QRA)  \nAl Baaz  (BA) or (BAZ)  \nAl Souqoor  (SO) or (SOQ)  \n   \n2. The collective political and military organisation of the Gold Alliance is as shown here:  \n \nFigure 1.1 – The Gold Alliance Organisational Structure   \nBACKGROUND  \n3. The Gold Alliance has been in existence for over 40 years and is the predominant  regional \norganisation for diplomatic, information, military and economic cooperation.  Most of the states \nwithin the Gold Alliance have large reserves of oil and all have seen rapid economic develop ment  \nover the past 60 years.  The Gold Alliance enjoys a strong internal bond based upon a common \nheritage.  Most countries have good bi -lateral relationships with the West ern and Asian States  and \ncooperation with partners  is seen as beneficial to the member states in their continued \ndevelopment.  The Gold Alliance states generally possess well equipped and modern armed \nforces.  Some of the states within the Gold Alliance have significantly strong er armed forces than \nothers .  All have forces which offer some de terrence against aggression but not all are strong \nenough to defeat a determined aggressor on their own .  The regional geography is shown in the \nmap below  \n \n1 Trigram for use in exercise simulation & data systems  \nSupreme Council of \nthe Gold Alliance\nDiplomatic \nCouncil\nDefence \nCouncil\nPeninsular \nShield Force \nCJTF\nComponents\nMilitary \nCommittee\nEconomic \nCouncil\nSecretariat \nGeneralHeads of States  \nMinisters  \nOperational \nCommander  Heads of \nMilitary   Political \nStrategic  \nLevel  \nMilitary \nStrategic \nLevel  \nMilitary \nOperational \nLevel  \nTactical Component \nCommander s Military  \nTactical   \nLevel  \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 1 - 2  \nFigure 1. 2 – CES Theatre of Operations   \n4. Collective Security .  A long -standing collective defence treaty exists between the 6 states  \nof the Gold Alliance.  Collective security is based on 3 inter -locking tiers of deterrence and \nCollective defence in the region summarised as follows:  \na. First Tier .  Each sovereign state is responsible for its own defence.  This includes \ninternal  security and defence against threats from terrorism and social unrest.  \nb. Second Tier .  The next tier is through collective security arrangements between  \nstates in the Gold Alliance .  This is based upon a commitment to mutual assistance such \nthat if any one country is attacked or threatened then the remainder will come to its \nassistance.  Regular exercises are conducted with troops of one alliance nation deploying \nto another to practi se responses against a variety of threats , and to ensure that Command \nand Control arrangements are continually practi sed and refined.  \nc. Third Tier .  The final tier, and the last resort, is the intervention by the international  \ncommunity either through bi -lateral defence agreements or the deployment of a coalition \nforce under international authorisation , generally a United Nations Security Council \nResolution (UNSCR) . \nTHE RED ALLIANCE  \n5. The Red Alliance is a grouping of 2 states whose people  share some elements of common \nheritage and historically have formed a strong political union of mutual interest.  The states of the \nRed Alliance are:  \nAl Seel   (SE) or (SEL) \nAl Bwar h (BW) or (BWR) \n6. Economies .  Historically these states received substantial backing from the USSR .  Since \nthe breakup of the Soviet Union , they have suffered economically as a result of a lack of external \nsupport  although the 2 countries generate significant income from the export of hydrocarbons .  The \n\nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 1 - 3 countries of the Red Alliance have in the past claimed part of the oil wealth held by the Gold \nAlliance states , specifically in A l Salaam  and in the territorial waters of countries bordering the \nnorthern Arabian Gulf.  \n7. Foreign Policies .  Over the past 10 years, the political role of the Red Alliance has \nbecome less prominent .  The foreign policies of the 2 member states  have d iverged in some areas \nand this has led to differences of approach where policies conflict.  Both countries have in the past \nsupported insurgent forces in other countries in the region in order to further their political aims.  \nBoth nations  possess ballistic missile capabilities that can threaten all the Gold Alliance countries.  \n8. Military Forces .  The Red Alliance states place a priority on maintaining large, well -trained \narmed forces equipped with relatively modern weapons in order to maintain a superior military \ncapability compared with other regional forces.  Full details of the doctrine and capabilities of the \nRed Alliance military forces are in the  current edition of the  Red Alliance Handbook.  \nCOUNTRY PROFILES  \n9. Profiles for all the countries of both the Gold and the Red Alliance are at Section 2 of this \npublication.  \nOTHER COUNTRIES AND GROUPINGS  \n10. Other countries in the region have historic ties to one or more nations within the 2 alliances \nwhilst others remain firmly non -aligned .  These countries are:  \nMahhar  (MA) or (MAR)   Zembala  (ZE) or (ZEM)  \nAzhir  (AZ) or (AZR)   Cascara  (CA) or (CAS)  \nGambala  (GA) or (GAM)   Karjastan  (KA) or (KAJ)  \nKindu  (KI) or (KIN)   Kuristan  (KU) or (KUR)  \nMitanni  (MI) or (MIT)   Nambutu  (NA) or (NAM)  \nSheba  (SH) or (SHB)   Al Amarja  (AM) or (AMJ)  \n11. Terrorism .  There are a number of  terrorist threats across the region.   Intelligence \nsummaries (INTSUMs) will be issued should the terrorist threat in any area become significant.  \n12. Mahhar  (MAR).  The island of M ahhar  lies to the EAST  of Al S ouqoor  in a strategic  \nlocation.  It is on the easterly approaches to the Strait  of Hormuz  and the entrance to the Arabian \nGulf.  This maritime commercial \nroute is a choke point through \nwhich transit commercial tanker \nships carrying 17 million  barrels \nof oil daily ; equivalent to  20 to \n30 percent of the world's total \nconsumption.   Mahhar  is split \ninto 2 small independent \nstates : Northland , a traditional \nally of  Al Seel, and Southland, \nhistorically allied with  Al \nSouqoor .  A location  and \nphysical map of Mahhar are \nshown below  and details on the \nIsland are in Section 2 Country \nProfiles : \n \nFigure 1.3 – Location Map of Mahhar.  \n\nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 1 - 4  \nFigure 1. 4 – Physical  Map of Mahhar  showing Mines and Offshore Oil Fields.  \nAREAS OF CONFLICT AND THREAT  \n13. The disputes  between the Gold and Red Alliances are  focused in 3 major areas:  \na. Political and Economic .  A long running dispute over oil resources and an  \nimbalance of economic development has led to a number of territorial disputes in the past \n40 years  in the north of the Arabian Gulf.  \nb. Ideological .  The second cause of dispute is ideological between the region’s main  \npowers over political leadership of the entire region .  Al Seel  has recently achiev ed a \ndegree of  prominence , if not dominance,  at the expense of the other larger powers . \nc. Military .  The most significant military threats derive from the Red Alliance ’s \nsubstantial  ballistic missile capability , and significant naval forces that have the capability of \ndisrupting  regional maritime trade routes.  The Straits of Hormuz and Bab  Al Mandeb have  \ngeostrategic significance on worldwide and regional shipping movements.  \n14. Section 2 of this scenario contains a series of ‘country profiles ’ summarising the key \ncharacteristics of the nations of both alliances  and Mahhar  Island . \n\nEdition 8 EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 1 SECTION  2 – COUNTRY  PROFILES  \nAL SALAAM \nINTRODUCTION \n1. Al Salaam  occupies  a strategic  location  at the head  of the Arabian  Gulf bordering  Al Bwarh\nand Al Noor.   It is one of the smallest  countries  in size of the Gold  Alliance  (GA)  but is a driving\nforce  behind  the cohesion  that has been  achieved  within  the GA.  As such, Al Salaam wields\nconsiderable soft power, both within the GA and amongst the international community as a whole.\nAl Bwarh  claims  oil resources  in the north  of the country  which has frequently been a source of\ntension in the past .\n2. Geography . Al Salaam  has a land border  of 462 km and a coastline  of 499 km.  The\ncountry  has a harsh,  dry desert  climate  with great  extremes  of temperature  and a short  cool winter.\na. Terrain .  The terrain  is mostly uninhabited,  sandy  desert  with population  centres\naround  the coast.   It is predominantly  undulating  desert  plain.   Less  than one per cent of the\nland area is suitable  for cultivation.   The territory  of Al Salaam  includes  9 islands  in the\nArabian  Gulf,  2 of which  (Bubiyan  and Warbah)  are strategically  important  and the location\nof a new super port facility .\nb. Resources .  Petroleum,  fish, shrimp  and natural  gas.\nc. Environment .  The climatic  conditions  mean  that there  are limited  freshwater\nresources  so some  of the world’s  largest  and most  sophisticated  desalination  facilities\nprovide  much  of the water.   About  75% of potable  water  must  be distilled  or imported.\n3. Population .  The population  in 2023 was approximately  4.79 million  of whom  29% were\nunder  25 years  of age.\nDETAILS  \n4. Government  and Political .  The country  is politically  stable.   It is divided  into 6\ngovernorates:  Al Ahmadi,  Al Farwaniyah,  Al Asimah,  Al Jahra,  Hawalli  and Mubarak  Al Kabeer,\nthat elect  representatives  to fill a 50-seat National  Assembly.   The political  system  in the country  is\nmature.\n5. Economic .  Al Salaam  is a small,  rich, open  economy  with prove n crude  oil reserves  of\nabout  96 billion  barrels  (10%  of world  reserves).   Petroleum  accounts  for nearly  half of GDP,  95%\nof export  revenues,  and 80% of government  income.   Al Salaam ’s climate  limits  agricultural\ndevelopment.   Consequently,  with the exception  of fish, it depends  almost  wholly  on food imports.\nThe main  industries  are: petroleum,  petrochemicals,  cement,  shipbuilding  and repair,  desalination,\nfood processing,  and construction  materials.\nINFRASTRUCTURE  \n6. The infrastructure  of the country  is well developed  between  dense  population  centres.\nRecently  a new deep -water  port has opened  on Bubiyan  Island,  and there  has been  extensive\ninvestment  in road and hotel  infrastructure  in the North  East.   The strategic  infrastructure  of the\ncountry  is comprehensive  and modern.\n7. Airports .  There  is a total of 7 airports  in Al Salaam  but not all are in use.\n8. Critical  Infrastructure .  Other  critical  infrastructure  is summarised  in the table  over the\npage :\nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 2 Ser \n \n(a) Category  \n \n(b) Unique  \nIdentifier  \n(c) Name  \n \n(d) Location  \n \n(e) Government  \nPriority  \n(f) \n1 \nGovernment  \nBuildings  SA-GOVB -01 National  Assembly  2917N  \n4750E  \n1 2 SA-GOVB -02 Ministry  of Defence  2917N  \n4755E  \n3 SA-GOVB -03 Ministry  of Interior  2917N  \n4759E  \n4 SA-GOVB -04 Foreign  Ministry  2917N  \n4803E  \n5 SA-GOVB -05 Finance  Ministry  2915N  \n4752E  \n6 SA-GOVB -06 Energy  Ministry  2915N  \n4802E  \n7 Desalination  \nPlants  SA-DSAL -01 Doha  East \nDesalination  Plant  2922N  \n4748E  4 \n8 \nOil and Gas \nFields  SA-OILF -01 Burgan  Oil Field  2907N  \n4758E  \n3 \n9 SA-OILF -02 Raudhatain  Oil Field  2955N  \n4749E  \n10 Commercial  Ports  \nand Dockyards  SA-PORT -01 Al Salaam  City Port 2922N  \n4758E  2 \n11 SA-PORT -02 Bubiyan  Port TBC 1 \n12 \nPower  Stations  SA-POWR -01 Mina  Al Zour South  2842N  \n4822E  \n5 13 SA-POWR -02 Subiya  Power  Plant  2934N  \n4809E  \n14 SA-POWR -03 Shuaiba  South  \nPower  2902N  \n4809E  \n15 SA-POWR -04 Doha  West  Power  2922N  \n4747E  \nFigure  2.1 – Al Salaam  Critical  Infrastructure  \n \n \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 3 AL NOOR  \nINTRODUCTION  \n1. Al Noor is the dominant  country  of the Gold Alliance  due to its economic  strength  and \ncentral  location.  \n2. Geography .  Al Noor is the largest  country  in the Middle  East (80%  of the Arabian  \nPeninsula)  and is bordered  in the east by the Arabian  Gulf and in the west by the Red Sea.  It has \na coastline  of 2640  km and land borders  of 2940  km.  The country  has a harsh,  dry desert  climate  \nwith great  extremes  of temperature.  \na. Terrain .  The terrain  is mostly uninhabited,  sandy  desert  with population  centres  \naround  the coast  and interior  oases.   Less  than one per cent is suitable  for cultivation.   A \nhigh escarpment  parallels  the Red Sea between  the Gulf of Aqaba  and the Gulf of Aden  \nwhich  drops  off gently  to the east.   A second  escarpment  (the Jabal Tuwayq) runs north  to \nsouth  through  the area of Riyadh .  The south  of the country  is dominated  by the Rub Al \nKhali desert.  \nb. Resources .  Petroleum,  natural  gas, iron ore, gold,  copper.  \nc. Environment .  The climatic  conditions  and large  population  have  led to \ndesertification,  the depletion  of underground  water  resources  while  the lack of perennial  \nrivers  or permanent  water  bodies  has prompted  the development  of extensive  seawater  \ndesalination  facilities.  \n3. Population .  The population  in 2023 was approximately  32 million  of whom  40% were  \nunder  25 years  of age. \nDETAILS  \n4. Government  and Political .  The country  is politically  stable.   It is divided  into 13 provinces : \nAl Bahah,  Al Hudud  ash Shamaliyah,  Al Jawf,  Al Madinah,  Al Qasim,  Ar Riyad,  Ash Sharqiyah  \n(Eastern  Province),  Asir, Ha'il,  Jizan,  Makkah,  Najran  and Tabuk , that elect  representative  to fill a \n200-seat National  Assembly.  \n5. Economic .  The Al Noor  economy  is oil-based  with strong  government  controls  over major  \neconomic  activities.   Al Noor  possesses  25% of the world's  proven  petroleum  reserves  and ranks  \nas the largest  exporter  of petroleum.   The petroleum  sector  accounts  for roughly  75% of budget  \nrevenues,  45% of GDP,  and 90% of export  earnings.   About  40% of GDP  comes  from the private  \nsector.   Priorities  for government  spending  in the short  term include  additional  funds  for education  \nand for water  and sewage  systems.   The major  industries  are crude  oil production,  petroleum  \nrefining,  basic  petrochemicals,  ammonia,  industrial  gases,  sodium  hydroxide,  cement,  construction,  \nfertilizer,  plastics,  commercial  ship repair,  and commercial  aircraft  repair.  \n6. Infrastructure .  The infrastructure  of the country  is well developed  between  dense  \npopulation  centres.   The strategic  infrastructure  is comprehensive  and modern  with links between  \nall major  population  centres  and externally.  \n7. Railways .  There  is a total of 1392  km of railways  in the country,  mainly  of standard  gauge.  \n8. Airports .  There  is a total of 201 airports  in Al Noor  but not all are in use. \n9.

Murjan is a wealthy country on the southern side of the Arabian Gulf to the west of Al Qrain \nconsisting of a number of islands, the largest being Murjan.\n2. As well as an independent supplier of oil and gas, the Murjan financial markets are a major \nsource of revenue.\n3. Political.  Murjan is a constitutional monarchy headed by the King, and the government is \nrun by the Prime Minister.  As prime movers in trying to ensure a future for the Regional Stability \nTreaty, a conference was held in Murjan in July 2021 following the Red Alliance’s conflict with the \nGold Alliance in the Autumn of 2020.  It was only partly successful, with spoiling tactics being  \nplayed by the Red Alliance.  Al Seel has previously claimed Murjan as part of its territory which  \nremains a source of friction in the region. \nDETAILS  \n4. Geography .  Murjan is a generally flat and arid archipelago in the Arabian Gulf.  It consists\nof a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point 134 m (440 ft)\nabove sea level.\n5. Population .  Murjan has a population of 1. 58 million of whom 31% were under 25 years of\nage.\n6. Economic .  Oil and gas account for more than 50% of GDP, roughly 70% of export\nearnings, and 85% of government revenues.  A tried and tested regional financial hub for global\ninvestment houses is rapidly proving to be a growing source of GDP.  Prove n reserves of natural\ngas exceed 10 trillion cubic metres and production is seen as secure in the medium term.  Long -\nterm goals feature the development of offshore natural gas reserves to offset the ultimate decline\nin oil production and this is likely to b e done in conjunc tion with Al Qrain.\n7. Infrastructure .  The infrastructure of the country is well established with a road bridge\nconnecting Murjan with Al Noor as well as an international airport leading to a sophisticated system\nof internal lines of communication.

Al Qrain is a prosperous country on the southern side of the Arabian Gulf consisting of a \nnumber of islands and mainland territory.  Its economy is based upon the export of hydrocarbons \nand trade within the region.  \n2. Al Qrain is an independently wealthy country with her own large oil  and gas  reserves . The \nArabian Gulf forms the border between Al Qrain and Al Seel whilst it has a land border with Al \nNoor.  \n3. Political .  Al Qrain has an unelected, monarchic, emirate -type government.  There are no \ndemocratic institutions or elections, and power is assumed on a hereditary basis.  Al Qrain has \nbeen a supporter of the Regional Stability Treaty even though it knows that if it were to become a \nsignatory, there could be a hostile reaction from Al Seel.  \nDETAILS  \n4. Geography .  Al Qrain has a coastline  of approximately 832 km and a limited land border \nwith Al Noor.  Its main natural resources are petroleum, natural gas and fish.  Approximately 0.5% \nof the land is arable.  There are limited freshwater  resources and so there is an increasing \ndependence upon desalination facilities.  The highest point in Al Qrain is Qurayn Abu al Bawl at \n103 metres (338 ft).  \n5. Population .  Al Qrain has a population of approximately 3 million people of which 24. 8% \nare under the age of 25 years.   \n6. Economic .  Oil and gas account for more than 55% of GDP, roughly 85% of export \nearnings, and 70% of government revenues.  Proven oil reserves of 16 billion barrels should \nensure continued output at current levels for 23 years.  Proven reserves of natural gas exceed 14 \ntrillion cubic meters, more  than 5% of the world total and third largest in the world.  Long -term \ngoals feature the development of offshore natural gas reserves to offset the ultimate decline in oil \nproduction.  The main industries consist of crude oil production and refining, ammon ia, fertilisers, \npetrochemicals, steel reinforcing bars, cement, commercial ship repair.  \n7. Infrastructure .  The infrastructure of the country is well established with a sophisticated \nsystem of internal lines of communication.

Al Baaz is a member of the Gold Alliance with sea borders on the Sea of Oman and the \nArabian Gulf, and land borders with Al Souqoor, and Al Noor .  It occupies a strategic location along \nthe southern approaches to the Strait of Hormuz.  \n2. Geography . Al Baaz has a land border of 954 km and a coastline of 1318 km.  The country \nhas a dry desert climate with cooler weather in the eastern mountains.  \na. Terrain .  Flat, barren coastal plain merging into rolling sand dunes of vast desert \nwasteland with mountains in the east.  Just over 0.5% of the land is arable.  \nb. Resources .  Petroleum and natural gas.  \nc. Environment .  The climatic conditions mean that there are limited freshwater  \nresources so most water is derived from desalination facilities.  \n3. Population .  The population in 2023 was approximately 11.7 million of whom 2 4% were \nunder 25 years of age.  \nDETAILS  \n4. Government and Political .  The country is politically stable.  Al Baaz’s political system is \nbased on its 1968 Constitution, which is composed of several intricately connected governing \nbodies ensuring that it is neither a constitutional monarchy nor a republic.  It is divided into 7 \ndistricts: Abu Zaby (Abu Dhabi), Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah (Sharjah), Dubayy (Dubai), \nRa's al Khaymah and Umm al Qaywayn , that elect representatives to fill a 60 -seat National \nAssembly.    \n5. Economic .  Al Baaz’s wealth is based on oil and gas output (about 30% of GDP), and the \nfortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities.  Since the discovery of oil \nAl Baaz has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region to a  modern state \nwith a high standard of living.  Al Baaz has an open economy with one of the highest per capita \nincomes in the world and a sizable annual trade surplus.  In 2009, its GDP, as measured by \npurchasing power parity, stood at US$ 400.4 billion.  A massive construction boom, an expanding \nmanufacturing base, and a thriving services sector are helping Al Baaz diversify its economy.  \n6. Infrastructure .  The infrastructure of the country is generally well developed between \ndense population centres.  Al Baaz has an extensive road network that connects all major cities \nand towns.  Roads in the western and southern regions are still relatively undeveloped.  The \nstrategic infrastructure of the country is comprehensive and modern with links between all major \npopulation centres and externally.  \n7. Airports .  There is a total of 22 airports (13 paved) in Al Baaz but not all are in use.  \n8. Critical Infrastructure .

Al Souqoor is a country located on the south east flank of the Arabian Peninsula and is a \nstrong member of the Gold Alliance.  The country includes the strategically important Musandam \nPeninsula adjacent to the Strait of Hormuz, which is vital for the transit of crude oil to world \nmarkets.  \n2. Geography . Al Souqoor borders the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman and shares land \nborders with Al Noor and Al Baaz.  It has land borders of 1374 km and a coastline of 2092 km.  \nThe climate is dry desert, hot, humid along the coast with a hot dry interior.  \na. Terrain.   The country’s terrain is dominated by a central desert plain and rugged \nmountains in the north and south.  Less than 0.25% of the land is arable.  \nb. Resources .  Petroleum, copper, asbestos, some marble, limestone, chromium, \ngypsum and natural gas.  \nc. Environment .  The climatic conditions and large population have led to \ndesertification and the depletion of underground water resource, while the lack of perennial \nrivers or permanent water bodies has prompted the development of extensive seawater \ndesalination facilit ies. \n3. Population .  The population in 20 23 was approximately 5.17 million of whom 38% were \nunder 25 years of age.  \nDETAILS  \n4. Government and Political .  The country is politically stable with a head of state who also \noversees the Government.   It is divided into 8  areas: Ad Dakhiliyah, Al Batinah, Al Wusta, Ash \nSharqiyah, Az Zahirah, Masqat, Musandam and Zufar, which  elect representatives to fill a 200 seat \nNational Assembly.   It has historical ties and good relations with Southland on Mahhar Island.  \n5. Economic .  The country of Al Souqoor is a middle -income economy in the Middle East with \nnotable oil and gas resources, a substantial trade surplus, and low inflation.  Industrial \ndevelopment plans focus on gas resources, metal manufacturing, petrochemicals, and \ninternational trans -shipment ports .  Other industries include crude oil production and refining, \nnatural and liquefied natural gas (LNG) production, construction, cement, copper, steel, chemicals \nand optic fibre.  \n6.

Al Bwarh  is a country of strategic importance located on the Shatt al Arab waterway at the\nnorth western end of the Arabian Gulf.  Its economy is based upon the export of hydrocarbons and\ntrade within the region and politically it is one of the 2 member countries  of the R ed Alliance  (RA).\nIts leadership is anti -western and is trying to exert influence both within the RA and in the Region\nmore generally.\n2. Geography . The country has arid desert land west of the River Euphrates, a broad central\nvalley between the River Euphrates and the River Tigris, and mountains in the northeast.\na. Terrain .  Mostly broad plains; reedy marshes along Al Seel  border in the south with\nlarge flooded areas; mountains along borders with Al Seel  in the east and along the north\nwest border.\nb. Resources .  Petroleum (143.1 billion barrels (22 .75 billion  m3)) of prove n oil\nreserves), natural gas, phosphates  and sulphur.\nc. Environment . Government water control projects have drained most of the\ninhabited marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting the feeder streams\nand rivers; a once sizable population has been displaced; leading to soil degradation\n(salination) and erosi on; desertification.\n3. Population .  The population in 20 23 was approximately 43 million of whom 60% were\nunder 25 years of age.\nDETAILS  \n4. Government and Political .  The country was politically stable but lately there have been  \ndemonstrations against the government, as the economy has contracted.  It is divided into 18 \ngovernorates that elect representatives to fill a 300 seat National Assembly.  The Eastern Al Anbar \nGovernorate, which has some historic tribal affiliations to Al Noor has been a focus of unrest and \nprotest against the central government and its perceived belligerence.  The political system in the \ncountry is socialist in orientation and influence from its historic connections to the countries of the \nformer Soviet Union.\n5. Economic.  The Al Bwarh economy is dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally  \nprovided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings.  However, per capita output and living  \nstandards are well below the average for the region. GDP is $649.3 billion (2022 est.). Industries \nare mainly petroleum, chemicals, textiles, construction materials, food processing, fertilizer, and \nmetal fabrication and processing.\n6. Infrastructure.  A sophisticated system of internal lines of communication and external  \nlinks, especially to the east to Al Seel and through the ports in the south east of the country.  The \nkey strategic infrastructure of the country is comprehensive and modern with links between all \nmajor population centres and externally.  Sea access is restricted to 3 ports in the south east of the \ncountry.\n7. Railways.  There is a total of 2200 km of railways in the country.\n8. Airports.  There is a total of 79 airports in Al Bwarh but not all are in use.\n9. Ports.  There are 3 commercial ports in the country; Umm Qasr contains both the principal  \ncommercial port and the primary naval base. \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 15 Ser \n(a) Name  \n(c) Location  \n(d) Notes  \n(e) \n1 Al Basrah  3030N 4747E   \n2 Khawr az Zubayr  3012N 4753E  Oil Terminal  \n3 Umm Qasr  3002N 4757E  Includes Naval Base  \nFigure 2.7  – Al Bwarh Commercial Ports  \n10.

Al Seel  is a significant regional power which is strategically  located south of the Caspian \nSea on the Arabian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, which are vital maritime pathways for crude oil \ntransport .  Its economy is based upon the export of hydrocarbons and trade within the region .  \nPolitically it has been the more dominant of the 2 countries of the R ed Alliance but  is now being \nchallenged by the more radical and outspoken Al Bwarh  leadership.  \n2. Geography . The country has a land border of 5440 km of which 1458 km is with its \nwestern neighbour and Red A lliance partner Al Bwarh .  It has a mostly arid or semiarid climate.  \na. Terrain .  The terrain is generally rugged.  It has a mountainous rim; high, a central \nbasin with deserts, mountains and small plains along both coasts.  It has an extensive \ncoastline of 2440 km of which 740 km is along the Caspian Sea.  Only 10% of the country \nis suitable for agriculture, the remainder is generally mountainous.   The central plateau \nconsists of desert and salt pans  and is largely uninhabited and uncultivable.  The Alborz \nMountains lie across the north of the country.  The almost impassable Zagros mountains, \nwith peaks between 4000 and 4500 metres, run from Northwest to South East, parallel with \nthe Arabian Gulf.  \nb. Resources .  Petroleum, natural gas, coal, chromium, copper, iron ore, lead, \nmanganese, zinc  and sulphur.  \nc. Environment .  The main environmental concern is air pollution, especially in urban \nareas, from vehicle emissions, refinery operations, and industrial effluents.  In addition , \ndeforestation, overgrazing, desertification, oil pollution in the Arabian Gulf, wetland losses \nfrom drought, soil degradation (salination), inadequate supplies of potable water, water \npollution from raw sewage and industrial waste , and urbani sation place pressure on the \nlimited resources of the country.  \n3. Population .  The population in 20 23 was approximately 85.3 million of whom 37% were \nunder 25 years of age.  \nDETAILS  \n4. Government and Political .  The country is relatively politically stable.  It is divided into 30 \nprovinces : Ardabil, Azarbayjan -e Gharbi, Azarbayjan -e Sharqi, Bushehr, Chahar Mahall va \nBakhtiari, Esfahan, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Hamadan, Hormozgan, Ilam, Kerman, Kermanshah, \nKhorasan -e Janubi, Khorasan -e Razavi, Khorasan -e Shemali, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh va Buyer \nAhmad, Kordestan, Lorestan, Markazi, Mazandaran, Qazvin, Qom, Semnan, Sistan va \nBaluchestan, Tehran, Yazd  and Zanjan , which  send representatives to a National Assemb ly of 310 \nseats based in the capital Tehran.  The political system in the country is socialist in orientation \nderiving from its historic connections to the countries of the former Soviet Union.  \n5. Economic .  Al Seel ’s economy is marked by a large, inefficient state sector, over reliance \non the oil sector, and statist policies that create major distortions throughout.  Most economic \nactivity is controlled by the state.  Private sector activity is typically small -scale workshops, farming, \nand services, but this has not eased economic hardships such as high unemployment and high \ninflation.  The proportion of the economy devoted to the development of military capabilities \nremains a contentious issue with leading G old Allianc e nations.  Exports amount to petroleum \n(60%), chemical and petrochemical products, and agriculture products, plus cement and other \nconstruction materials, food processing (particularly sugar refining and vegetable oil production), \nmetal fabrication, and ar maments.  \n6. Infrastructure .  The infrastructure of the country is well established with a sophisticated \nsystem of internal lines of communication constrained by the geography of the country.  The key \nstrategic infrastructure of the country is comprehensive and modern with links between all major \npopulation centres and externally.  \n7. Railways .  There is a total of 8442 km of  railways in the country, mainly of standard gauge.  \n8. Airports .  There is a total of 115 airports in Al Seel  but not all are in use.  \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 18 9. Critical Infrastructure .

22 MAHHAR ISLAND  \n1. The island is oval shaped, 190 miles (305 km) long and 88 miles (140 km) wide at the \nwidest part.  The Island is made up of a mix of mountainous rugged terrain and coastal plain. The \nisland is split into 2 countries:  NORTHLAND and SOUTHLAND.  \n2. MAHHAR is rich in natural resources, notably uranium, which sits astride the border, and \nhas recently discovered oil reserves offshore to the north -east of the Island.   \nGEOGRAPHY  \n3. Ground .  The major geographical  freedoms and \nconstraints are as follows:  (Fig 2.10 Mahhar  map). \na. The mountains on the north -east side dominate \nthe island, which rise to about 600 metres and are \nseparated by the border.  The upper slopes of the \nmountains are impassable to all vehicles, including \ntracked vehicles.    \nb. The lower slopes of the 2 major mountains and \nthe coastal plain are more open; the ground is hard, and \nvegetation is fairly sparse.  \nc. The rest of the island is made up of gentle rolling \nplains broken by some large forests, which are \nobstacles to tracked vehicle movement.  \nd. All rivers are obstacles that can only be crossed \nwith specialist bridging equipment or marked fording \ncrossing sites.  \ne. The island’s coastal area is a mix of severely \nrocky terrain and unrestricted beaches, all of which are \nsuitable for amphibious operations.  \nf. The SE of the island is lower lying and is prone to \nflooding and often takes the brunt of tropical storms \nmoving from the Indian Ocean into the Arabian Sea.  \nThe climate is sub -tropical.  \n4. Roads .   \na. The road system as marked is good.   \nb. The main rivers are never dry, and are crossed in \nseveral places by wide, strong road bridges (MLC 85) \nsuitable for use by heavy armoured vehicles.   \nc. The dirt roads provide alternative routes for \nmovement, with caution, and cross the rivers only at \nfordable points.  \n5. Airports .  There are 2 airfields on the island.  \na. NORTHLAND .

Until the 18th Century, MAHHAR was a remote, undeveloped island populated by 2 main \ntribal groups; the TAREQ Tribe and the MARFAN Tribe.   \na. TAREQ .  The TAREQ were fishermen, Dhow captains and farmers who originated \nfrom AL SOUQOOR and live mainly along the south, south -eastern and eastern coast of \nMAHHAR.  They share cultural, religious and tribal ties with AL SOUQOOR.   \nb. MARFAN .  The MARFAN were an aggressive tribe who originally migrated from the \nSE of AL SEEL and occupied the northern coast of MAHHAR, expanding their foothold into \nthe central hills and western end of the island.  The MARFAN retained close cultural, \nreligious an d tribal ties with what they considered their traditional ‘homeland’, AL SEEL.  \n2. British Rule .  The British took control of the island in 1785 and were able, through firm \npolicing to control the hatred between the TAREQ and the MARFAN tribes.  A large number of \nTAMON workers arrived with the British from India and  still live on the island to this day.  Religion \nhas always played an important part in life on MAHHAR and the 2 main religions, PHALONISM \nand DEISM, were encouraged by the British as a way to break down the ancient tribal barriers.   \n3. Independence .  Resistance to British rule increased during the Twentieth Century. In the \n1950’s this developed into a brief but violent insurgency.  MAHHAR achieved independence from \nBritain in 1952; but was split into 2 independent states; NORTHLAND and SOUTHLAND, whi ch \nwere based broadly along the traditional ethnic tribal areas of the TAREQ and MARFAN Tribes.   \n4. Northland .  NORTHLAND developed into a single political party nationalist style nation \nwith close political, military and economic ties to AL SEEL and the RED ALLIANCE.  Its political \nand economic performance has declined since the end of the Cold War.  Despite its Ur anium ore \nresources, it has lost its large markets in the former USSR and now relies on AL SEEL and AL \nBWARH as its sole customers.  \n5. Southland .  SOUTHLAND developed into a democratic nation with many political parties \nand a strongly developing economy based on uranium exports, maritime trade, agriculture, fishing \nand more recently a developing oil and gas sector with considerable reserves.  Politic ally, culturally \nand economically, SOUTHLAND has developed ties with the GOLD ALLIANCE, particularly AL \nSOUQOOR, and their Western Allied Nations  \nPOLITICAL OVERVIEW  \n6. NORTHLAND and SOUTHLAND have a history of uneasy political relations that have been \nmarked by periods of armed confrontations between the 2 states, particularly over the marking of \nthe current border.  \n7. Tensions between NORTHLAND and SOUTHLAND arise from tribal and religious \ndifferences of the populations of both states; access to the important natural resources of the \nUranium mines and recently developed offshore oil and gas fields on the NE coast of MAH HAR.   \nPOPULATION  \n8. Northland .  The population of NORTHLAND is 500,000 and predominantly made up of the \nMARFAN Tribe (75% - 375,000 people) who originate from Al SEEL and a majority practice the \nPHALONIST religion.  They have kept close cultural, economic and political links with AL SEEL.  \nThere are 2 other minority groups of note:  \na. Ethnic TAREQ Tribe who are mainly PHALANONISTS (15% - 75,000) who occupy \nareas of the central plain between the town of JALZOOR and the border.  \nb. Ethnic TAMONS (10% - 50,000) who live in the town of HAFAR and up to the \nborder with SOUTHLAND and practice the HENTIC Religion.  \n9. Southland .  The population of SOUTHLAND is 500,000 and made up of 4 ethnic groups:  \na. The TAREQ Tribe who originated from Al SOUQOOR and practice mainly DEISM \nbut have a sizable minority group who follow the PHALONIST religion.  In Total they make \nup about 60 % (300,000) of the population.   \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 25 b. The TAMON Ethnic group who originate from INDIA make up about 20% (100,000) \nof the population and practice the HENTIC Religion  \nc. Ethnic MARFANs, both DEIST and PHALONIST are about 17% of the population \n(85,000) and are in 2 main areas:  along the north coast up to and including the town of \nHADAD, and from the border uranium district up to and including the town of LAFY.   \nd. AL SOUQOOR Expats.  SOUTHLAND has a small but \ninfluential AL SOUQOORIAN population of around 15, 000 (3%) \nwho have retained much of the good agricultural land around the \ntown of ROOZ and have retained a key financial interest in the \nUranium belt along the border and have invested in the off -shore \noil exploration with local and foreign partners.   \n \nFigure 2.1 1: MAHHAR ISLAND Ethnic Distribution Map. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 2 - 26  \n \n \n \n \nMAHHAR ISLAND RELIGION S \n \nFigure 2.1 2: MAHHAR ISLAND Religious  Distribution Map. \n \n\nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nSECTION 3 - 1 SECTION 3 – SPECIAL IDEA  \n \n1.

For a long time, Al Bwarh has claimed land in the north part of Al Salaam.  \nAl Bwarh believes that the money  generated  from the oil fields along with  access to ports along the \nnorth -western Gulf coast will solve  its current financial  problems and increase  the opportunities for \neconomic development.  Al Seel also claims undersea oil deposits and small islands within the \nterritorial waters  and exclusive economic zones of Al Salaam, Murjan, Al Qrain and Al Baaz .   \n2. Red Alliance .  The Red Alliance has recently  started a strategic communication campaign \nrepeating these claims with renewed force .  As a result, d iplomatic relations between the member \ncountries of the 2 alliances have become strained .  Al Seel and A l Bwarh  have also started to \nmobilise elements of their armed forces and are planning and conducting large scale military \nexercises.  The Red Alliance  are also supporting terrorist organisations operating within the Gold \nAlliance countries, and are providing finance, equipment and training to subversive elements in \norder to increase internal tensions within these nations.  \n3. Gold Alliance .  The Gold Alliance’s political position is firm.  While it is prepared to provide \neconomic assistance  and trade with  the Red Alliance nations, it will not accept any alteration to the \ncurrent Gold Alliance national boundaries .  The Gold Alliance  has declared that it will collectively \ndefend its member states ’ borders with military force , if required.  It has stated that its strategic  \nobjective is to maintain the territorial integrity of the Gold Alliance members and the political \nfreedom and prosperity of its citizens in the long -term.  It will achieve these strategic  objective s by \naction along the lines of:  \na. Diplomatic  engagement and negotiation.  \nb. Information  consistency in message and narrative.  \nc. Military readiness and preparedness to act ; where and when appropriate.  \nd. Economic cooperation with Red Alliance countries; where appropriate.  \n4. International Community .  The International Community takes considerable interest in the \nstability of the Gulf region due both to its dependence upon hydro -carbon exports from most of the \ncountries of the Gold Alliance, and from strong historical and cultural ties.  Western Nations, \nincluding the United Kingdom, the United States and many other countries have publi cly declared \nthat they would be prepared to assist in maintaining regional stability and have conducted \nextensive military exercises in the region during the past 15 years.  Additionally, b oth the United \nKingdom and the United States have strong bi -lateral  ties with Al Salaam.  There are mature plans \nto reinforce Gold Alliance countries if required with the UK and the US committed to providing most \nof the Tier 3 military forces.  \n \nFigure  3A.1 Red Alliance Threats  \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 1 ANNEX 3B - SITUATION  AS AT 30 SEP 20 \nGENERAL  \n1. Al Bwarh has  had a long running  border dispute over land and access to the coast  in the \nnorth of Al Salaam.  This minor border dispute is seen as an opportunity by some elements of the \nRed Alliance leadership to trigger a wider regional conflict.  After high level diplomatic discussions \nfailed to reach any form of agreement Al Bwarh and Al Seel broke off diplomatic relations with \ncountries of the Gold Alliance in Jan 20 and started to raise the readiness levels of elements of \ntheir armed forces.  \n2. International diplomatic efforts have continued to try and broker an agreement to the \ndispute and to ensure that the position of each country is clear.  The position of Al Salaam and the \nother  countries of the Gold Alliance is firm.  While they are prepared to offer economic assistance \nto countries of the Red Alliance, and in particular Al Bwarh, they will not accept any alteration to \nthe current  GOLD  Alliance boundaries.  The Gold Alliance member states  have stated publicly , on \nmany occasions , their willin gness to use force to defend themselves using  the Gold Alliance \nestablished  collective security agreements.  The Gold Alliance will protect the freedom and \nprosperity of its citizens in the long term along the following lines:  \na. Diplomatic negotiations where possible.  \nb. Information messag ing and narrative  promotion . \nc. Military readiness to act , where and when appropriate.  \nd. Economic and other aid to countries of the Red Alliance , where and when \nappropriate.  \n3. Through international diplomatic forums such as the UN, EU and OSCE, the countries of \nthe World  have endorsed the position of the Gold Alliance and some have declared their resolve to \nprovide diplomatic, economic and, if necessary, military support to assist their allies in the region.  \nRECENT EVENTS  \n4. During the period Jun to Aug 20, a number of small -scale  border incursions occurred in Al \nSalaam territory by land, air and maritime forces of Al Bwarh and Al Seel.  These were assessed \nas probing activities conducted in order to test the readiness and responsiveness of Al Salaam \nforces and to test the political resolve and cohesion of the Gold Alliance and their international \nsupport.  \n5. In response to these incursions the Gold Alliance increased the readiness of units  in the \nPeninsular Shield Force on 15 Sep 20 in order to be prepared to react quickly to any requests for \nassistance from Al Salaam.  This included the establishment of a Combined Joint Task Force HQ \nto provide military C2 and contingency planning, located in Camp Arafjan  and reporting to the GA \nMilitary  Committee .  Concurrently, various Western countries including the UK and US deployed \nOperational  Liaison and Reconnaissance Teams in order to conduct combined planning with the \nArmed Forces of Al Salaam and the Maritime, Land and Air Force Components  of the Peninsular \nShield Force  CJTF HQ .  OPLAN 01 dated 30 Sep 20 has been issued . \n6. Red Alliance Forces .  Diplomatic activity is ongoing,  but the c ountries of the Red Alliance, \nAl Bwarh  and Al Seel , have taken little notice of the International and Gold Alliance diplomatic \nengagement .  Both Red Alliance states have continued to reiterate claims to various territorial \nareas and rights to hydrocarbon deposits in Gold Alliance territory.  The following activity has been \nconducted during the period 15 to 30 Sep 20: \na. Land Forces .  The structure of the Red Alliance land forces remains as per the Red \nAlliance Handbook  (Chapter 2, Section 1) with the following additional detail:  \n(1) 1 Combined Arms Army (CAA) .  1 CAA is the most capable of the Al \nBwarh land forces but is significantly under strength in manpower and lacks much \nserviceable equipment.  It is assessed that 80 S eparate Motor Rifle Regiment (80 \nSep MRR)  is the most capable formation as it has  been the focus for new \nequipment and training.  The Regiment is assessed to be ready for operations now.  \nThe remainder of the CAA is being reinforced from across the Al Bwarh land forces \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 2 and conducting readiness training.  I t is assessed that 40 M otor Rifle Division (40 \nMRD)  will be ready for operations before the end of Oct 20, followed by the majority  \nof 50 MR D, 60 Tank Div ision and 70 Tank Div ision in late Nov 20 or early Dec 20.  \nElements of supporting Divisional level or Army level combat support (CS) and \ncombat service support (CSS)  units  are being brought to a high state of readiness in \nline with the Combat Arms  units . \n(2) 2 CAA .  2 CAA remains in the area of K irkuk  and further north and remains \ncommitted to internal security operations.  It is assessed that the formation will be \ncommitted to these tasks for the foreseeable future.  \n(3) 3 CAA .  3 CAA remains in the region of T ehran  and is currently assessed to \nbe poorly equipped and trained.  It is assessed that the Army could deploy a Tank \nRegiment  and separate Motor Rifle Regiment  at 100% CE plus CS and CSS \ncapabilities by the end of Nov 20.  It is assessed that the Army could not deploy \nother Force Elements within the next 4 months.  \n(4) 4 CAA .  4 CAA remains in the region of K erman and is committed to key \npoint protection and reserve tasks.  It is assessed that the Army could not deploy \nforces to threaten Gold Alliance countries within the next 18 months.  \nb. Air Forces .  The organisation  and locations of significant Red Alliance country Air \nForces is described in the Red Alliance Handbook  (Chapter 2, Section 3) .  Availability of \naircraft is between 80 and 95% and standards of training are assessed as high.  The Air \nForce of Al Bwarh is capable of conducting offensive operations now.  \nc. Maritime .  The Naval Forces of the countries of the Red Alliance are described in \ndetail in the Red Alliance Handbook  (Chapter 2, Section 5) .  Al Bwarh has a more  limited \ncapability structured to provide limited patrolling capability.  Al Seel possesses a capable \nMaritime force which has a variety of tasks . \nOPERATIONAL TIMELINE  \n7. The information from the situation at 30 Sep 20 is summarized in the operational timeline \nshown below.  \n \nFigure 3 B.1 – The Situation at 3 0 Sep 20 \n\nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 3 GOLD Alliance CJTF J 5/001/01A  \n30 Sep 20 \nSee Distribution  \nCJTFHQ OPLAN 01 – OPERATION SWORD  (Extract)  \nReferences:  \nA. GA Military Committee Strategic Operational Directive dated 22 Sep 20. \n \nTime Zone Used Throughout this Directive: Local (CHARLIE) GMT +3.  \nPREFACE  \n1. Scope .  This OPLAN 01 provides the initial overarching direction for the campaign.  A JCO \nwill be issued, as necessary, for each period, stage or phase of the campaign to provide executive \nauthority (orders). OPLAN 01 provides the Commander’s assessment of the current situation and \nsets out  his operational design (intent and Op framework) to resolve the crisis.  As the situation \ndevelops it may be necessary to revise both the operational design and OPLAN.  Any revision will \nbe guided by strategic direction, the assessment process and battle rhythm of the CJTF HQ.  \n2. Period .  OPLAN 001 covers the entirety of the campaign in outline but focuses on the \ndeployment of the CJTF to support AL SALAAM Tier 1 forces to DETER the RED Alliance and, if \nnecessary, CONTAIN and DEFEND against any military incursions.  \nSITUATION  \n3. Overview .  For the past 3 months historical tensions between the GOLD and RED Alliance \nStates over oil and gas resources, the location of international borders and political ideology have \nincreased significantly.  This has created a dangerous situation that may cause  military conflict \nbetween the two Alliances.  Since June 20, RED Alliance forces have initiated minor clashe s at \npoints of tension along our Alliance borders and in our territorial waters .  Most recently  this has \nfocused  specifically within the sovereign territory of AL SALAAM.  In addition, s ince the 15 SEP 20 \nthe RED Alliance have been openly increasing the operational readiness of their Armed Forces \nand making warlike preparations.  \n4. Political Environment .  On the 15 SEP 20 the Supreme Council of the GOLD Alliance \nagreed to collectively respond to this clear threat to both AL SALAAM and the wider GOLD \nAlliance.  Member States agreed to increase the readiness of their own forces and to establish this \nGOLD Alliance CJTF HQ and component HQs to provide integrated C2 and conduct contingency \nplanning.  Concurrently, the GOLD Alliance continue with their diplomatic efforts to try and DETER \nthe RED Alliance and broker a resolution to the dispute using international forums such as th e UN, \nEU and Regional non -aligned States to assist.   \n5. Strategic Environment .   \na. Opposing Actors .  The opposing actors are the two members of the RED Alliance , AL \nSEEL and AL BWARH.  No other states have openly declared support for the Red Alliance.  \nAl BWARH is considered the political driving force behind the potential conflict.  AL SEEL has \nbeen restrained in its support for AL BWARH.  \nb. Friendly and Cooperating Actors .  The member states of the GOLD Alliance have \ncommitted to provide military forces for their mutual defence through the mechanism of the \nPENINSULAR SHIELD Force, coordinated by this CJTF HQ  and subordinate components .  \nIn addition, both the governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom \nhave committed forces to the defence of the GOLD Alliance if required.  \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 4 c. Neutral Actors .  Regional States have declared support for a diplomatic resolution but \nnot openly committed to either the RED or GOLD Alliance.  Considerable diplomatic pressure \nis being placed on AL BWARH and AL SEEL by Regional and International Governments to \nlower t ensions and avoid war.  \n6. Operational Environment .  The military conflict is focused in the NW end of the ARABIAN \nGULF and specifically on the land, air and maritime borders between AL SALAAM and AL \nBWARH.  However, conflict is likely to spread and military activity could occur at any point within \nthe territorial borders or Exclusive Economi c Zone of the GOLD Alliance.  Accordingly, planning \nand the JOA will reflect this.  \n7. Information Environment .  International opinion is firmly behind a diplomatic resolution of \nthe crisis.  However, the Red Alliance is perceived as the aggressor in the majority of reputable \nnews media outlets and social media platforms both within the Gulf region and internationally . \n8. Political Direction and Guidance .   \na. GOLD Alliance Strategy .  The Supreme Council has discussed the current situation \nand come to the conclusion that some form of armed conflict with the Red Alliance is \npossible.  However, the Council understands that the cost of conflict, both in terms of \ncasualties and economic damage, will be large.  The member states have agreed to have a \nparallel approach.  First seek a diplomatic solution and deter the RED Alliance using \ncoordinated strategic communications.  Second, prepare for the worst -case  enemy COA – \narmed conflict and invasion of GOLD territory.   \nb. GOLD Alliance Strategic Endstate .  The Supreme Council has agreed the following \nstrategic endstate:   \n“A Stable GULF region, with the GOLD Alliance Member States PROTECTED, their peoples \nREASSURED, and their borders, resources and eco nomy SECURED.”  \nc. Strategic Objectives .  (Diplomatic , Information  and Economic)  \n(1) DETER the RED Alliance from military activity against AL  SALAAM and/or the \nwider GOLD Alliance. (D)  \n(2) DEVELOP a political settlement to enable regional stability. (D)  \n(3) SHAPE international opinion to support the GOLD Alliance’s actions. (D)  \n(4) REASSURE the people of the GOLD Alliance. (D)  \n(5) PROMOTE G OLD Alliance support for a political settlement . (I) \n(6) SUPPORT GOLD Alliance oil and gas production and exports. (E)  \nd. Military Strategic Objectives.  In support of the Strategic Military End State, the \nMilitary Strategic Objectives are:  \n(1) SECURE the Borders and territorial integrity of AL SALAAM and the GOLD \nAlliance.  \n(2) SECURE the maritime and air lines of communication of the GOLD Alliance.  \n(3) PROTECT the people, critical national infrastructure,  and economic resources of \nthe GOLD Alliance.  \n(4) DEVELOP the military capability of the Peninsular Shield Force.   \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 5  \ne. Military Strategic End State.  The Supreme Council of The GOLD ALLIANCE has \nagreed that their coalition  military  strategic end -state is:   \n“A stable region where GOLD ALLIANCE armed forces are able to DETER external \naggression, the people  and economic interests are PROTECT ED and national \nsovereignty  and territorial integrity of the GOLD Alliance  states is  SECURE .”  \nf. Strategic Centres of Gravity . \n(1) GOLD Alliance .  The strategic centre of gravity is the GOLD Alliance Supreme \nCouncil.  (Moral  Strength ) \n(2) The RED Alliance .  The strategic centre of gravity is the leadership of AL \nBWARH.  (Moral Strength ) \ng. Strategic Assumptions . \n(1) Allied western countries will continue to provide political, economic and military \nsupport to the countries of the GOLD ALLIANCE to form the GA coalition.  \n(2) Weapons of mass effect will not be used (Nuclear/Chemical/Bio).  \n(3) No direct (Formed units) third party state military external  assistance will be given \nto the RED Alliance .  Equipment and intelligence may be provided by third party states.  \nh. Constraints : \n(1) Joint Operational Area  (JOA).  The Joint Operations Area (JOA) is defined by \nthe territorial boundaries of GOLD ALLIANCE, plus their territorial waters and all \ninternational waters and airways within the area bounded by 10 degrees and 38 \ndegrees North and 38 degrees and 63 degrees East.   Extension of the JOA to include \nRED ALLIANCE states and their territorial waters and air space will require GOLD \nALLIANCE Defence Council  consent.  \n(2) Legal .  The GOLD ALLIANCE military activity is justified on the basis of UN \nCharter Article 51: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of \nindividual or collective self -defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the \nUnited Nations” .  The GOLD Alliance is an organisation that applies the principle of \ncollective defence to its member states.  \n(3) Law of Armed Conflict .  The conduct of military operations must be in \naccordance with the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  All military operations must \ncomply with the four basic principles of the LOAC, namely Military Necessity, \nProportionality, Distinction and Humanity.  \n(4) Right of Self Defence .  The inherent right of self -defence applies at all times.  \nThere has been no restriction on this right.  \n(5) Intelligence Sharing .  Direction on intelligence sharing between GOLD Alliance \nStates and the US and UK tier 3 forces will be issues separately.  \n9. Strategic Commander’s Mission . The Strategic Commander is to DETER the RED \nAlliance, PROTECT the GOLD Alliance from external military threats to its people and critical \ninfrastructure and SECURE its territorial integrity; in order to set the military conditions for regional \nstability.   \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 6  \n10. Strategic Comd’s Intent .  (‘What ’ we will do ) \na. The Strategic Commander’s intent is to DETER the RED Alliance from armed conflict \nwith the GOLD Alliance, PROTECT the GOLD Alliances’ people, critical infrastructure and \neconomic interests and SECURE the GOLD Alliance’s territory.  If necessary, this may \nrequire the GOL D Alliance to DEFEAT any RED Alliance military activity.  \nb. We will DETER attack and PROTECT our territory with a clear demonstration of the \nGOLD Alliance’s defensive preparation and strong commitment to collective defence.  If \nDETERRENCE fails, attacks by RED Alliance forces, wherever they occur within the GOLD \nAlliance, will initially be BLOCKED .  The CJTF will then DEFEAT and CLEAR the RED \nAlliance forces from our territory.  \nc. Success will be when our territorial sovereignty is SECURED; the CJTF in a defensive \noverwatch PROTECTING the people and interests of the GOLD Alliance and the RED \nAlliance is DETERED from further offensive military actions.  This should lead to a decrease \nin tension allowing a political settlement and a mutual gradual reduction in military readiness, \nthe re -deployment of Tier 2 and 3 forces and a normalisation of regional stability.  \n11. Strategic Comd’s Main Effort .  To SECURE the territorial sovereignty of the GOLD \nAlliance.  \nOperational Direction  \n12. Mission .  The GOLD Alliance CJTF is to SECURE our Alliances’ territorial sovereignty  and \nPROTECT our people and interests in order to set the military conditions for a gradual return to \nregional stability.  \na. Tasks . \n(1) Establish a CJTF in the JOA.  \n(2) SECURE the territorial sovereignty of the GOLD Alliance.  \n(3) DETER the RED Alliance from military activity against the GOLD Alliance.  \n(4) PROTECT the people, critical infrastructure and economic interests of the GOLD \nAlliance.  \n(5) SECURE Air and Sea lines of communication.  \n(6) On Orders, be prepared to:  \n(a) NEUTRALISE RED Alliance forces.  \n(b) DEFEAT RED Alliance forces in GOLD Alliance territory.  \n(c) CLEAR RED Alliance forces from GOLD Alliance territory.  \n(d) SECURE the Strait of Hormuz.  \n(e) NEUTRALISE, DEFEAT or DESTROY RED Alliance ballistic  and cruise  \nmissile capability.  \n(f) NEUTRALISE, DEFEAT or DESTROY RED Alliance Submarine capability.  \n  \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 7  \n13. COM CJTF Concept of Operation . (‘What’ we will do)  \na. Intent .  My intent is to GUARD our borders and PROTECT the GOLD Alliance’s people \nand interests.  This will assist in strategic DETERRENCE against any RED Alliance attack \nand SECURE our territorial sovereignty.    If attacked, we will BLOCK, DEFEAT and CLEAR \nany enemy forces in our territory and re -SECURE our territorial sovereignty.  \nOn threat of attack, i nitially we will GUARD the borders of the GOLD Alliance to SECURE our \nterritorial sovereignty and PROTECT the people, the critical Alliance infrastructure and \neconomic interests.  Concurrently we will form the CJTF and develop our UNDERSTANDING \nof the situation as Tier 2 Peninsular Shield forces and Tier 3 forces from Allies deploy, train \nand are integrated into the CJTF components.   \nIf an attack occurs, we will initially BLOCK  or ISOLATE  the RED Alliance forces.  This will \ngenerate the time required for planning and deployment of the main elements of the CJTF \ncomponents to SHAPE the JOA, gaining the required control of the air and sea, prior to joint \nmanoeuvre within the JOA to DEFEAT the  enemy, CLEAR his forces from our territory and \nre-SECURE the territorial sovereignty of the GOLD Alliance.  In all situations the CJTF must \nbe prepared to NEUTRALISE, DEFEAT or DESTROY additional elements of offensive RED \nalliance military capability  wher ever they are,  if this is required to create the military \nconditions to end the conflict or ensure enduring regional stability.  \nOnce the operational objectives have been achieved the CJTF assume a defensive \noverwatch.  At this point we will also RECUPERATE and RECONSTITUTE units,  as \nnecessary.  Ideally this would be coordinated with some form of politically generated cease \nfire or the ending of armed conflict.  If armed conflict continues, we must be prepared to \ncontinue to defend the GOLD Alliance,  as necessary .   \nSuccess will be when our territorial sovereignty is re -SECURED.  The CJTF will then be \ndeployed in a defensive overwatch to GUARD the borders once again and we will continue \nPROTECTING the people and interests of the GOLD Alliance.  We will maintain our \ncoordinated Alliance UNDERSTAND and FIND capabilities to watch for potential future RED \nAlliance military activity.  Once the Alliance is no longer threatened militarily, the CJTF will \ngradually reduce its readiness and deployment to a peacetime level as reg ional stability is \nreestablished.  \n14.

Decision Points (DP) . \na. DP 1.  Has Deterrence (DC3) worked? Sequel 1 activated if RED attack and occupy \nGOLD territory.  \nb. DP 2.  DC7 achieved; c an we move into transition phase?  \n22. Scheme of Manoeuvre .   \na. PHASE 1: SHAPE  – The purpose of this phase is to assemble and rapidly deploy \nforces into the JOA, complete the preparations for military actions and ensure the GOLD \nAlliance is PROTECTED (DC1) IOT REASSURE the people of GA and DETER RED Alliance \n(DC3) against aggression and conflict. The clear message I want to send to the RED Alliance \nis: “We are prepared to defend our Alliance. If you attack us, you will pay a heavy price and \nfail”. This phase will begin with rapid deployment within the JOA of Tier 2 and Tier 3 forces.  \nTo do this, MCC will start to SECURE SLOCs throughout the SoH and the AG and \nSUPPORT  the deployment of the  Tier 3 forces.  In this phase and ongoing through to the end \nof Phase 3, the AC will commence operations; Air mobility to support deployment, ISR to \nfocus on FIND and UNDERSTAND of the of the RED Alliance Forces deployments and DCA \nwithin sovereign territory to G UARD and SECURE the Alliance. This phase will end when all \nforces are within the JOA at IOC or FOC and theatre conditions are estab lished  (DC2). \nb. PHASE 2: ENGAGE  – This phase will begin if there is a widespread failure to DETER \nthe RED Alliance (DC3) and military conflict starts.  DP1 activates Sequel 1 and the need for \nRED  Alliance Forces to be CLEARED from GOLD Alliance Territory  (DC6).  Initially we may \nneed to BLOCK or ISOLATE RED  forces  using Tier 1 Forces within State boundaries  \nsupported as necessary by CJTF Tier 2 and 3 forces .  This will create time for us to complete \ndeployments and SHAPE the JOA .  The MC, supported by the AC, will achieve sea control \nIOT SECURE SLOCs (DC5) in the Arabian Gulf and SoH.  The AC will achieve Control of the \nAir (DC4) within the JOA IOT provide the freedom of movement and manoeuvre and set the \nconditions for the RED forc es to be DEFEATED then CLEARED from GOLD Alliance territory \n(DC6) and the re -establishment of GOLD territorial integrity (DC7).  This may require some \nadditional targeting of RED Alliance offensive capabilities inside the RED Alliance territory.  \nc. PHASE 3: TRANSITION  – The phase will set the conditions for the long -term and the \ngradual redeployment of the CJTF Tier 2 and 3 forces.  This phase will begin after DP2, once \nGOLD Territorial integrity is SECURE (DC7) and hostilities have ended. The LC Tier 1 forces \nwill continue to provide security presence and GUARD the land borders and establish \nsecurity activities and protocols in coord ination with national governments. ISR assets will \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3B - 12 continue to maintain the JOP. CJTF HQ will coordinate with governments to HAND -OVER \ninternal security , once a political settlement process  is ESTABLISHED  and the humanitarian \nsituation is STABILISED . Tier 2 and Tier 3 forces will prepare to REDEPLOY.  Once CJTF \nsuccessfully hands over border and internal security to the government Tier 1 Forces  and a \nGOLD theatre reserve is ESTABLISHED , CJTF transition will be enabled (DC8) , then  GA \nCJTF forces will REDEPLOY back to pre -conflict posture. This phase will end with a return to \npeacetime readiness, force locations, deployments and activity levels.  \n23. Main Effort .   \na. Phase 1:  Deployment of the Tier 3 Land Forces.  \nb.

Al Seel  Maritime Operations .  At sea, A l Seel maritime forces have started\nunannounced, limited but aggressive patrolling operations in the southern Arabian Gulf (AG),\nStrait of Hormuz (SOH) and Sea of Oman (SOO) .\n2. Initial Gold Alliance “Q4” Analysis .  the G old Alliance  Military Strategic Commander is\nextremely concerned  by these unforeseen Red Alliance maritime actions .  He consults with the\nGold Alliance Combined Joint Task Force Commander  (GA CJTF C) and they conduct a ‘Question\n4’ analysis; “has the situation  changed  and has this affected the overall outcome sought” ?  They\nconsider the following:\na. The Governments of the GOLD Alliance nations have made it clear that their political\npolicy is still to try, if possible,  and avoid escalation into all -out conflict with the Red Alliance .\nb. If armed conflict is unavoidable, it should be contained , minimized where possible,  and\nnot escalated  into a regional war.\nc. Phase 1 deployments of the Tier 2 and 3 Land Forces are not yet complete, and it is\nvery much in the Coalition's interest to deter or delay hostilities until the CJTF is completely\nready.   Therefore, e very effort should be made to avoid escalation .\nd. Al Seel has not yet committed any of its forces to North  Al Salaam  or into sustained\ndirect conflict  with the Gold Alliance , indicating that strategic deterrence is still having some\neffect .  However, Al Seel has raised the readiness levels of its armed forces  and moved\nelements of its Land Forces  towards the A l Bwarh  border  close to Basrah .\ne. It is politically extremely important that the Faylikah  and Abu Nasser  Island  issues do\nnot become joined.   They should remain bilateral disputes with Al Bwarh and Al Seel.\n3. Commanders’  Direction .  Both commanders agree that the situation has changed , but they\nare adamant that these relatively minor incursions do not change either  of their intent s or the\noverall concept of operations  at the strategic and operational -level.\na. The CJTFC  orders the GA CJTF  to accelerate Phase 1 deployments and operations\nand to be prepared to begin Phase 2 operations immediately, if ordered.\nb. He confirms that the current mission s and tasks  from OPLAN 01  (Issued yesterday)\nand JCO 01 (Issued  early  today)  remain valid, but there will be a few new additional tasks and\nconstraint s/restraints  that he will need to issue in FRAGO 1.\nOPERATIONAL TIMELINE  \n4.

CJTFHQ OPLAN O1 – OP SWORD  dated 30 Sep 20. \n \nTime Zone Used Throughout this Directive: CHARLIE  GMT +3 (local)  \n1. Scope.  This JCO gives executive direction for the conduct of operations during Phase 1 \nSHAPE , of Operation SWORD .  This is the phase of the campaign in which the GA is \nPROTECTED  (DC1)  by the CJTF  IOT REASSURE the people of GA and DETER RED Alliance \n(DC3) against aggression and conflict.   This phase will begin with rapid deployment within the JOA \nof Tier 2 and Tier 3 forces.  To enable  this, the MCC will start to SECURE SLOCs throughout the \nSoH and the AG and SUPPORT the deployment of the Tier 3 forces.  In this phase and ongoing \nthrough to the end of Phase 3, the AC will commence air operations; Air mobility to support \ndeployment, ISR to focus on FIND and UNDERSTAND of the of the RED Alliance Force s \ndeployments and DCA within sovereign territory to GUARD and SECURE the Alliance. This phase \nwill end when all forces are within the JOA at IOC or FOC and Theatre Conditions Are Established  \n(DC2).    This JCO describes the totality of the effects that the Joint Task Force (JTF) is to focus \nupon in this phase.  It also details the required synchronised Joint Actions that will realise these \neffects, as well as supporting and coordinating considerations .  The JCO also describes how the \nCJTF will operate with relevant civilian partners during Phase 1. \n2. Timings.   Phase 1 starts today the 1 Oct 20. It will continue until all forces are in the JOA at \nIOC or FOC and w e achieve  DC2, Theatre Conditions Established , expected to be on or around 5 - \n15 Nov 20.  The phase change will be conditions based and will be authorised by the COM CJTF \nat a Joint Coordination Board (JCB).  The conditions include: the achievement of IOC by the CJTF, \n(LCC 4 x Div at IOC; ACC at FOC, and MCC at FOC) and the achievement of DC2 - Theatre \nConditions Established .    Early move to Phase 2 could be triggered by a significant failure to deter \nthe RED Alliance (DC3) .  This will be  indicated by a significant attack by one or both of the RED  \nAlliance States  on the GOLD Alliance.    \nSITUATION  \n3. Overview.  The political situation remains tense .  The RED Alliance continues to increase \nthe read iness of their forces, conducting increased levels of training, deployments from home \nbases and  enhanced  patrolling.   Al BWARH and Al SEEL  have taken little notice of the \nInternational and GOLD Alliance diplomatic engagement  to stop a shift into unrestrained conflict .  \nBoth RED Alliance states have continued to reiterate claims to various territorial areas and rights to \nhydrocarbon deposits in GOLD Alliance territory . \n4. International and Regional .  There has been widespread international and regional \nengagement with  the RED Alliance Governments  in an effort to stop escalation of the conflict .    \n5. Enemy Assessment .  No change to reference A (OPLAN 01 ). Updates will be issued in a \nroutine  INTSUM . \nEXECUTION  \n6. Intent .  No Change  to Reference A, summarised as : DETER the RED Alliance from further \nattacks and incursions.  PROTECT the GOLD Alliance’s territory and vital interests, REASSURE \nthe people, and SECURE our sovereign territorial integrity.  \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3C - 4 We must FIND RED Alliance military capabilities and UNDERSTAND his intentions.  We will \nSECURE our Lines of Communication, including the Strait of Hormuz (SOH), GUARD our borders \nand PROTECT critical National Infrastructure.  We will DISRUPT enemy offensiv e activity, \nDEFEAT and CLEAR enemy forces positioned on our sovereign territory.  \nSuccess will be when our territorial sovereignty is SECURED and no longer threatened.  We will \ncontinue to GUARD our borders and PROTECT the people and interests of the GOLD Alliance.  \n7. Decisive Conditions (DCs) . DC to be achieved or initiated during Phase 1 are below.  More \ndetail on the operational effects (OEs) and Joint Actions (JAs) that sit below them, and how each \nCC will contribute to them, are in the Joint Action Table and  Joint Action Synchronisation Matrix  at \nAnnex es XX & XX  (to follow) : \na. DC 1:  GOLD Alliance Protected .   \nb. DC 2:  CJTF Theatre Conditions Established . \nc. DC 3:  RED Alliance Deterred . \n8. Joint Scheme of Manoeuvre . \na. DC 1: ‘GOLD Alliance PROTECTED’  (ACC Supported).   Timings - Start of Phase 1 \nAchieved by phase  start + 15 Days  and maintained for the whole campaign .  \n(1) From the very start we must PROTECT the GOLD Alliance  to stop the RED \nAlliance having a substantive harmful influence  or effect  on our CJTF, people s and \ninterests.   The Operational Effects to accomplish PROTECT must be executed  in \nevery one of the 5 Domains  (Maritime. Land, Air, Space & Cyber/EM)  and so will \ninvolve the whole  Combined Joint Task Force and civilian agencies .  Physical \nprotection from k inetic attack  will be our natural focus  but we must also consider the \nvirtual and cognitive aspects  of PROTECT  using information activities  that will be \nespecially  important during Phase 1 for both the population and critical infrastructure .  \n(2) All physical  & virtual  borders  with the RED Alliance  must be GUARDED  (OE 1.1, \n1.2 & 1.3) . While we expect activity to be focused on N AL SALAAM , the RED Alliance \nhave the capability to strike anywhere in the JOA.   Integrated Air Defence (OE 1.4) will \nbe essential to Critical National Infrastructure (OE 1.5) but also to we need to \ncommunicate all our activities to reassure the population  (OE1.6), maintain t heir \nmorale  and reduce the effect of conflict on the daily life of our citizens . \n(3) In Phase 1 , all DC 1 related  operational effects and actions will build \nincrementally as force levels increase.   Initially, we will need to rely on the Air \nComponent as Land Component force deploy and Maritime Component forces \nredeploy. Our activity  should be mostly  unchallenged b y RED forces  in the physical \ndimension but contested in the virtual and cognitive dimension .  This will change  \nsignificantly in Phase 2  or if major  kinetic offensive conflict starts  early .  Achieving the \nDC 1 PROTECT will then be harder and require a Prioritised Defended Asset List \n(PDAL) and risk/benefit analysis as part of  our b attle rhythm as the GOLD units and \ncapabilities are expended or neutralised by enemy actions.   \nb. DC 2: ‘CJTF  Theatre Conditions Established ’ (MCC  Supported).   Timings - Phase \n1 start .  Achieved by start of Phase 2 and maintained for the whole campaign .  \n(1) DC2 is about enabling the CJTF  to do its job  throughout the campaign .  Without \nDC 2  everything is  harder, slower,  or unsustainable for any period of time. Operational \neffects to achieve DC 2 start in Phase 1 and are key to facilitate the deployment , \npreparation , sustainment,  and recovery  of the CJTF .  The bulk of the inflow of Tier  3 \nLand forces and logistic support will be by sea.  Unopposed t heatre entry (OE 2.1) \ncannot be assumed  as the enemy knows that until Tier 2 & 3 forces have arrived \n(OE2.2) are at FOC  (OE2.3) and sustained  (OE2.5) , RED  has th e initiative . \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3C - 5 (2) Until DC 2 is substantially achieved, t he CJTF  is weakened and more vulnerable.   \nOur ability to see what  is happening through the joint operating picture (OE2.4) and \nrespond to enemy activity , especially in the Land domain, will be reduced .  Early in \nPhase 1 our  ability at do more than BLOCK and CONTAIN a RED  Land attack  is \nlimited.  DC 2 is therefore one of the key areas of risk to the force .  \n(3) CJTF Theatre Conditions Established  (DC 2 ) is one of the preconditions that \nmust be assessed and substantially met prior to a change  to Phase 2  ENGAGE .  \nc. DC 3: ‘RED Alliance DETERRED ’ (ACC  Supported).  Timings - Start Phase 1 after .  \nAchieved by Phase 2 plus 10 days.  \n(1) The Governments of the GOLD Alliance nations have made it clear to all that \ntheir political policy is still to try, if possible, and avoid escalation into all -out conflict \nwith the Red Alliance.   DC 3 is the operational -level military contribution to strategic \ndeterrence.  The CJTF must  send a clear message to the RED Alliance : “We are \nprepared to defend our Alliance. If you attack us, you will pay a heavy price and fail”.  \n(2) Our w ords must be aligned with our activities  in eve ry component .  Using all 4 \nelements of Joint Action, we must demonstrate in every domain , time and again , that \nthe CJTF  is united, determined, capable, and  prepared .   \n(3) Each component is to  demonstrate its capability  as part of its RSOI, training , \ninitial deployment,  and operations . This is how we will align or activities with our \nthemed messaging . \n9. Main Effort . ME for the entirety of Phase 1 is the deployment  of the Tier 2 and 3 Land \nForces.  (Linked to DC 2 and OE 2.3) \n10. Amplified Guidance.  \na. It is key that we successfully deploy our Tier 2 and 3 Forces rapidly and prior to any \nmajor combat.  No component should take actions that could be miss represented as \nescalation without consultation with this HQ.  \nb. Close coordination of the Air, Land and Maritime Components in order to generate a \nfull and coherent spectrum of capabilities will be critical to the DETER the RED Alliance  and \nPROTECT the GOLD Alliance . \nc. Throughout Phase 2.   Any change will be issued by FRAGO.  \n \n11. CJTF HQ Actions & Effects. See the Jt Effects and Actions Table at Annex XX  (to follow) . \n12.

Situation as at 17 Oct 20.  At 0530 hrs on 17 Oct 20 Al Bwarh  launched an unprovoked \nlimited offensive operation to seize terrain in the north of Al Salaam .   \na. The initial land force offensive consisted of 80 Sep MRR supported by elements of \nArmy Troops and limited air operations to achieve control of the air over their own forces .  \nThe forces penetrated approximately 5 km in the area of the A l Abdali  Border Post (QU \n6030).   \nb. Intelligence reports indicate that 2 further regimen ts of 40 MRD are in the final \nstages of deploying and it is assessed that they will cross the border region by \n271200 COCT20 in order to complete the securing of the northern oilfields.  The remainder \nof 1 CAA is continuing to mobili se and is expected to be ready at the beginning of Dec 20. \n2. International condemnation of these actions has been unanimous except for the initial \nresponse from Al Seel  which ha s stated its support for the actions of Al Bwarh .  Al Seel  is prepared \nto support Al Bwarh  if Al Salaam  or the Gold Alliance  takes any military action against the incursion \nforces.  Al Seel  has raised the readiness levels of its armed forces.  \n3. Response .  The following Gold Alliance  response has been planned:  \na. Tier 1 .  The C hief of Staff (C OS) of the Al Salaam  armed forces has been tasked  by \nthe GA CJTF  to CONTAIN and BLOCK the border incursion, develop plans for the eviction \nof Al Bwarh  forces (80 Sep MRR ) using Tier 1 forces  and deter further  Red Alliance  \naggression until Tier 2  and Tier 3 regional and international forces arrive . \nb. Tier 2 .  The Gold Alliance  has agreed to the immediate deployment of Force \nElements of the Peninsular Shield Force (PSF) to support Al Salaam  if required.  \nc. Tier 3 .  The Gold Alliance  has conducted initial planning and has stated that it \nconsiders itself capable of achieving its initial military objectives against Al Bwarh  armed \nforces  by deploying the PSF .  However , the Gold Alliance  has requested international \nassistance in the event that Al Bwarh  expands its limited attack or is reinforced by Al Seel  \nforces . Additionally, there is a possibility  that Al Seel  forces may act independently \nelsewhere in the GA territory to take advantage of the current unstable situation.  The UK \nand US have commenced the deployment of Force Elements to the region in anticipation of \na broader Red Alliance  action and to demonstrate political support of the Gold Alliance . \n4. Command and Control .  The command structure for Tier 1 operations is shown in the \nGold Alliance Handbook (Section 1, Para 8).  The command structure for Tier 2 and Tier 3 \noperations is explained in Para 9 of Section 1 of the G old Alliance  Handbook . \nOPERATIONAL TIMELINE  \n5.

Situation as at 27 Oct 20.  At 0530 hrs on 27 Oct 20 Al Bwarh  escalated significantly its \naggressive military action  in North AL SALAAM , indicating that operational -level deterrence has \nfailed.    \na. Intelligence reports indicate that 40 MRD have begun to  cross the border region in \norder to reinforce 80 Sep MR Regt , expand the lodgment inside A l Salaam territory  and try \nto complete the securing of the northern Al Rawdatayn  oilfields  and greater access to the \nArabian Gulf .   \nb. The remainder of 1 CAA is continuing to mobili se and is expected to be ready at the \nbeginning of Dec 20. \n2. Al Seel  has not yet committed any of its forces to North  Al Salaam  or into sustained  direct \nconflict  with the Gold Alliance , indicating that strategic deterrence is still having some effect .  \nHowever, Al Seel  has raised the readiness levels of its armed forces  and moved elements of its \nLand Forces  towards the A l Bwarh  border  close to BASRAH .   \n3. Response .  The following Gold Alliance  response has been planned:  \na. Tier 1  & 2.  Land Component  Commander  has been tasked  by the GA CJTF  to \nBLOCK and CONTAIN the expanded  Al Bwarh incursion, using Tier 1 and Tier 2  regional \nland forces.   \nb. Tier 3 .

The political situation has not improved and there is no indication that the RED \nAlliance is seeking a diplomatic settlement to the situation .  Isolated and geographically limited \nmilitary conflict has commenced.  \n4. International and Regional .  There has been widespread international and regional \ncondemnation of Red Alliance offensive military activity in the North of AL SALAAM.  The Supreme \nCouncil of the GOLD Alliance has issued a statement condemning the RED Alliance actions and \nurging them to withdraw quickly from AL SALAAM territory before the clashes escalate out of \ncontrol.  \n5.

M y intent is, to BLOCK and CONTAIN RED Alliance land forces in the NORTH of AL \nSALAAM  and on islands in the GULF .  We will DETER further reinforcement of the lodgement s \nand try and COERCE their withdrawal back across the international border.  Thus, trying to stop \nescalation of the conflict.  If RED do not withdraw  but tries to  reinforce , we will DEFEAT and \nCLEAR the enemy from GOLD Alliance Territory.  This may also require attacks on RED Alliance \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3E - 4 combat power in depth .  Success in Phase  2 will be  when we re -SECURE our territorial integrity \nand our forces have assumed strong defensive positions to meet any further RED Alliance \ncounterattack . \n7. Decisive Conditions (DCs) . DC to be achieved or initiated during Phase 2 are below.  More \ndetail on the operational effects (OEs) and joint actions (JAs) that sit below them, and how each \nCC will contribute to them, are at Annex XX  (to follow) : \na. DC 4:  AIR in the JOA  CONTROLLED .  (Note that the JOA has expanded from Phase \n1 to include the RED Alliance territory ). \nb. DC 5:  Maritime Lines of Communication in the GULF and Strait of HORMUZ \nSECURED.  \nc. DC 6:  RED Alliance Forces CLEARED from GOLD Territory.  \nd. DC 7:  GOLD Alliance Territorial Integrity SECURED.  \n8. Joint Scheme of Manoeuvre . \na. DC 4 : ‘AIR in the JOA  CONTROLLED ’ (ACC Supported).   Timings - Start of Phase \n2 for 3-10 Days.  \n(1) Prior to any major ground or maritime manoeuvre,  it is essential that we gain \ncontrol of the air.  In Phase 2 the CJTF moves to a more assertive and offensive \nposture and actions due to  the failure of our deterrence and the offensive activity and \ninvasion of GOLD territory by the RED Alliance.  This is enabled by a n expand ed JOA \nand a change to  our ROE to allow GOLD offensive activity in RED territory.  \n(2) Control of the air will contribute to our ability to BLOCK and CONTAIN RED \nlodgments and stop RED providing support or reinforcements .  Once achieved, DC4 \nwill allow reapportionment of air capability to support LC C and M CC actions  to initially \nCOERCE RED retreat and if necessary, DEFEAT and CLEAR RED forces from our \nterritory.  \nb. DC 5 : ‘Maritime Lines of Communication in the GULF and Strait of HORMUZ \nSECURED ’ (MCC  Supported).   Timings - Phase 1 start .  Achieved by Phase 2 plus 6 \ndays.  \n(1) Operational effects to achieve DC5 started in Phase 1 and have been partially \nsuccessful.  However, in Phase 1 all operational effects and actions were unopposed \nby RED  forces.  OE 5. 3, OE5.4 and OE5.5 are all linked to FOM  in GULF and SOH \nand are now challenged by  RED maritime and air forces  threatening transiting \ncommercial shipping and oil tanker traffic .  The achievement of DC4 wi ll the assist the \nMCC in achieving DC5, but the RED SSK threat (OE 5.6) will need to be rapidly  \nNEUTRALISED  before success can be achieved . \nc. DC 6: ‘RED Alliance Forces CLEARED from GOLD Territory ’ (LCC Supported).  \nTimings - Start Phase 2 after DC 4 achieved .  Achieved by Phase 2 plus 10 days.  \n(1) After initially BLOCKING and CONTAINING all RED forces within GOLD territory, \nthe CJTF will try and COERCE the m to withdraw  back to their own territory.   This is to \ntry and reduce the chance of the conflict escalating unnecessarily.  If the RED forces \ndo not withdraw and/or they continue offensive actions, then the CJTF will DEFEAT  \nand CLEAR them out using joint manoeuvre.  This may require CJTF forces to cross \ninto the RED Alliance territory to gain a position of advantage.   This border crossing \nwill be temporary,  and forces are to be redeployed  within our GOLD territory as soon \nas is militarily practical.   This is likely to be at different times for each component.  \nd. DC 7: ‘GOLD Alliance Territor ial Integrity SECURED ’ (LCC /MCC  Supported).  \nTimings - Start Phase 2 after DC 6 achieved.   Achieved by Phase 2 plus 1 5 days.  \n(1) DC7 requires t he CJTF to SECURE the land, maritime and air borders  of the \nGOLD Alliance .  This will need to be achieved either in or out of conflict.   \nEdition 8  EXERCISE FICTION  \nAnnex 3E - 5 (2) If conflict is continuing, the CJTF will assume a defensive posture forward of the \nland and mariti me borders with a LOE.  Joint fires  will then be used to NEUTRALISE , \nDEFEAT or D ESTROY  enemy threats  and offensive capability  before they can \napproach  our territory.    \n(3) If conflict has ceased and there is a stable ceasefire and political process  \nongoing, the CJTF will assume a defensive posture withing GOLD Territory  and BPT to \nDEFEAT a ny sudden RED C -Attack  and NEUTRALISE  or DESTROY  offensive \ncapability in depth.   \n(4) DP 2 will then be used to assess if the conditions to allow the CJTF to proceed to \nPhase 3 have been met.  \n9. Main Effort . ME for the entirety of Phase 2 is the Restoration of GOLD Alliance  territorial \nintegrity.  \n10. Amplified Guidance.  \na. Dormant ROE and changes to the JOA to enable Phase 2 have been authorised by \nthe Military Council and authority for release delegated to the COM CJTF .  \nb. Close coordination of the Air, Land and Maritime Components in order to generate a \nfull and coherent spectrum of capabilities will be critical to the BLOCK, COERCE and \nCOMPEL of RED Alliance break -in forces , and to the DEFEAT  and CLEAR  their forces \ncompletely from our territory  in Phase 2.  \nc. Throughout Phase 2.   Any change will be issued by further FRAGOs.  \n \n11. CJTF HQ Actions and Effects. See the Joint Effects and Actions Table at Annex XX  (to \nfollow) . \n12.

Protection of civilians.  Strict fire control will be necessary to minimize civilian \ncasualties in and around the combat zone.  Any incidents of CIVCAS are likely to have a \ndetrimental impact upon the CJTF’s narrative as it seeks to reassure a number of target \naudiences, not least the civilian population themselves.  Restricted Fire Areas (RFAs) should \nbe included in the joint plaint fires plan where logic suggests civilians will gather.  Targeting \nand P ositive ID measures must be strict and firmly applied.    \nd. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) . In Phase 2 ISR will continue \nto provide UNDERSTANDing of key A RED units and locations of targets.   \n(1) Phase 2 Priorities:  \n(a) UNDERSTAND.  \n(b) Targeting.  \n(c) Threat Warning.  \n(d) Operations Over -watch.  \n(e) Operational Assessment.  \ne.

At the operational level, CJTFHQ will exchange liaison officers with AL SALAAM MOD , \nin order to facilitate combined operational level planning as required.  \nb. At the tactical level, CCs are to identify and establish appropriate liaison relationships \nand populate these posts where possible.   They are to inform JTFHQ of the detail of their \nLNO networks in order to ensure efforts are properly coordinated.  \nc. For all LNOs detached from the main body of the JTF, CCs are to carefully consider \nthe FP and CIS security implications of their dispersal across the theatre.  \n \n \nAuthorise:  \n \n \n \nLt Gen \nCOM GOLD CJTF Authenticate:  \n \n \n \nMaj Gen  \nCOS CJTF HQ  \n \n",
  "file_5.pdf": "MUBARAK AL -ABDULLAH \nJOINT COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE \nRED ALLIANCE  HANDBOOK  \ne-Edition 4 - 2025\n\nEdition 4 \ni RED ALLIANCE HANDBOOK EDITION  4 –2025 \nINTRODUCTION  \n1. The Red Alliance Handbook  provides a Generic Enemy Force  reference document  for \nMubarak Al Abdullah Joint Command and Staff College (MAJCSC)  exercises .  The concept of a \nGENFORCE (or a Generic Enemy Force) was developed in the UK to provide details of an enemy \nforce against which the British Armed Forces  could plan and train.  The MAJCSC version \nconsider s both Operational Art and Tactical Doctrine, and the Organisation and Equipment of a \ngeneric enemy force based loosely on post -Soviet Russian doctrine and equipment.  Whilst this \nhandbook still extracts  some of the information from this post-soviet  period , it has been \nsignificantly updated and its  scope extended  to include global maritime and air forces  equipment . \n2. During exercises, students will fight against elements of Red Alliance forces.  The land \nforces of the Red Alliance are focused on a Combined Arms Army (CAA) and provide detail down \nto battalion level.  The maritime and air forces are based on a wide range of equipment and \nsystems sourced from around the world.  They are not representative of the forces of any real \nnation and contain combinations of weapons and platforms that may not exist in the real world.  \n3. This handbook is designed to support all the exercises conducted at the MAJCSC that \ninvolve the nations of the Red Alliance from the conduct of the initial Intelligence Preparation of the \n(Land) Environment (IPE) exercise in Term 2 through to Exercise AMEL  AL MUSHTARAK, the \ncapstone exercise at the end of the course.  \n4. Chapter 1 provides an insight into how Red Alliance forces fight at the operational and \ntactical levels, with some useful planning yardsticks.  Chapter 2 shows how the Red Alliance forces \nare organised  with equipment numbers, characteristics and photographs.  \n5.

G-1 to G5  \nEdition  4 \n1-1-1 CHAPTER ONE  \nCONCEPTS AND DOCTRINE  \nSECTION 1 : RED ALLIANCE  PRINCIPLES OF WAR  \n1. The Red Alliance  principles of war apply across all domains;  however, their application will \nnot always be equal.  Whilst the principle of ‘concentration of force’ will always apply to some \ndegree, the requirements for concentration will differ significantly across the domains.  It is \nrecognised that these ‘principles of war’ are somewhat land -centric,  but this is no different from \ntheir application in the West and Red Alliance  commanders in the other domains are expected to \napply them appropriately.  \n2. Selection and Maintenance of the Aim .  In selecting the aim,  Red Alliance  commanders \nare taught to emphasise the destruction of the enemy.  \na. Operational Art .  The ultimate aim of any operation involving the Red Alliance  is \nthe utter defeat of the  enemy.   In future war  they will seek to fix  the enemy’s main striking \npower which will reside  in his fixed  and rotary wing aviation, missiles, long -range artillery \nand electronic warfare ( EW) capabilities,  and in  the Command, Control, Communications \nand Information ( C3I) systems  that direct them.  The primary task will thus always be the \ndestruction  of these means through the conduct of deep operations  on land and from the \nsea.  Red Alliance  doctrine is increasingly manoeuvrist which, along with an aggressive \nprocurement strategy, has significantly impro ved their effectiveness.  \nb. Tactics .  Red Alliance  commanders at division  / regiment  and regiment  / battalion \nwill be  expected to demonstrate much greater initiative in decision -making than in the  past \nand to rely much less on passing responsibility back up the chain of  command.   Though a \nnew concept for many of them, ‘mission command’ as understood in the west in \nincreasingly practised at all levels, significantly increasing their effectiveness.  \n3. Surprise .  Surprise is considered an increasingly important component of victory.   As the \nrange, accuracy and  destructiveness of weaponry increases, surprise also becomes essential not \nmerely  to victory but to survival in the face of modern weaponry.  It prevents the enemy  from \noptim ising the use of his forces and shortens drastically his available reaction  times, thereby \nhelping to preserve combat effectiveness.  \n4. Offensive Action .  In early versions of Red Alliance  doctrine this was known, somewhat \nclumsily, as ‘Activeness and Speed ’.  ‘Success in an operation or battle is achieved by that  side \nwhich, all else being equal, acts more actively and resolutely, takes the initiative  and holds it firmly.  \nA side which only defends is inevitably doomed to defeat. ’  Thus , a prominent Red Alliance  \ncommander demonstrates  the obsession with  seizing  and holding the initiative , whether in attack \nor defence.  \na. Significance of the Initiative .  The advantages which accrue to the defence  from \nground, concealment and modern firepower are all outweighed, in  Red Alliance  eyes, by \nthe advantage which poss ession of the initiative impart s to the attacker.   At all times, the \nRed Alliance  endeavours to maintain  an offensive state of mind in its commanders.  \nb. Constant Pressure .  There must be no let -up in the attack or counterattack  and \nevery effort must be made to tur n offensive action into pursuit.  Where  necessary, \nmomentum will be maintained through the acceptance of casualties,  loss of men and \nequipment being more acceptable than loss of time.   Time is  seen to be the most precious \ncommodity in modern war .  Plainly,  this principle is more difficult to li ve up to when on the \ndefensive.  \nc. Tempo .  Pressure on the enemy is not enough in and of itself.  A merely attritional  \napproach will grind down both sides .  The enemy must be unbalanced,  his command and \ncontrol must be disrupted,  and the will of his commanders  paralysed, and his forces must \nbe split up into isolated and demoral ised fragments which can be destroyed in detail.   In the \noffensive, this is  accomplished by achieving as early as possible a high tempo of \noperations .  The greatest possible  stress is laid on manoeuvre.  Bypassing will  usually be \nEdition  4 \n1-1-2 preferred to direct assault.  In the defence, emphasis is now placed on rapid regrouping \nand reaction by reserves.   Transition to the  counter -attack  / strike and counter -offensive is \nalways the goal.  In both offense and defence , the greatest possible stress is placed on the \nspeedy reactions of air, missile  and artillery strike systems , and the use of maritime and air \nmobil ity to carry the battle into the enemy’s depth.  \n5. Concentration  of Force .  Success stems from the concentration of superior force at the  \ndecisive time and place.  A defender, overstretched by being given an excessive sector  to defend, \ncan be defeated by an attacker with litt le or no overall superiority but possessing the initiative and \nwith the freedom to concentrate his efforts at the chosen  point of attack.  \na. Approach to Concentration .  The Red Alliance  follows 5 complementary  \napproaches to the problems of concentration to achieve the requisite correlation  of forces in \nthe offensive.   This is particularly evident in the land domain.  \n(1) Manoeuvre .  A superior enemy cannot be defeated in an attritional struggle.  \nOnly manoeuvre to create counter -concentrations and surprise will bring success.  \n(2) Deception .  The enemy must be persuaded through deception and feints to \nconcentrate  his forces on false axes, thus lowering the density of his offensive or \ndefence  on the chosen axes.  \n(3) Concentration of Fire .  Rather than massing forces to overwhelm the  \nenemy, fire s and electronic attack should be concentrated  on the selected sector \nfrom widely dispersed long -range systems, ships , submarines  and aircraft . \n(4) March Separately, Fight Together .  In the land domain, f ormations and \nmanoeuvre units will  advance rapidly from dispersed locations in depth, moving in \nmore or less  parallel columns and converging only at the last minute on the chosen  \nsector.  The most sudden and dramatic method of altering the  correlation of forces \non the chosen sector will be provided by air -mobility  or by amphibious operations \nfrom the sea . \n(5) Dispersal .  Concealed dispersion of units over a wide area, with regular re -\nlocation, aims to minim ise the effect of enemy strikes .  The use of amphibious \nforces which allow the sea -basing of troops, vehicles, equipment and logistic \nsupport are becoming increasingly important to Red Alliance  commanders.  \nb. Maintaining a Favourable Correlation of Forces .  Having broken through, \nadvancing forces will disperse to advance on multiple axes, but always with several \ncolumns within supporting distance.  Such a pattern of advance will fragment the enemy \nand complicate his use of reserves, maintaining the initially favourable correlation of forces.  \n6. Action Throughout the Enemy’s Depth .  The need to attack the enemy simultaneously \nthroughout  the entire depth of his deployment is a long-established  Red Alliance  principle.   In the \noffensive it is necessary to destabil ise the defence at the earliest  possible moment.  Keys to \naccomplishing this are the disruption of enemy C3I and  logistic support, the destruction, disruption \nor fixing of tactical and immediate  operational reserves , and the early seizure of vital ground in the \ndepth on which  the enemy could re-establish his defence if given the opportunity ( eg obstacle  \ncrossings, defiles, crossroads  etc).  Raiding detachments and deep strikes have become the \ncutting edge of contemporary formations, whether in attack or defence.  A regiment  may be tasked \nas an exploitation echelon by higher formations .  A combined arms battalion will often be sent out \nas a raiding or forward detachment.   Even in defence, observation of this principle is critical.  The \nconsiderable increase in air -mobility  and the fragmented, non -linear nature of the battlefield will \ncombine to make  the insertion of raiding forces and forward detachments much easier than it  was \npreviously, whether in attack or in defence.   Deep strike by air assets can also achieve the same \neffect.  \n7. Realism .  The successful commander is the one who best  balances the risks he faces so \nthat he can achieve his aim whatever counter -move  the enemy may undertake.  Essential to this \noutcome is continuous and effective  intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance at all \nlevels.  \nEdition  4 \n1-1-38. Cooperation .  As all arms are integrated into the battalion structure  and work  and train\ntogether, commanders can fully understand their individual  strengths and weaknesses and staffs\nbecome accustomed to coordinating their  actions.  In recent years, the Red Alliance  has become\nincreasingly manoeuvrist and concurrently has developed a more sophisticated Joint doctrine.\nIntegration of air power into the overall campaign plus increasing use of Close Air Support (CAS)\non the battlefields have become hallmarks of Red Alliance  ground operations which will be\nsupported, where appropriate,  with maritime power from the sea .  Specifically , these include the\nuse of amphibious forces for maritime power projection along with maritime fires, predominantly\nNaval Gunfire Support (NGS) to land operations.  The use of aircraft in the Counter Sea role where\nair power is used to support and protect maritime operations is increasingly evident.\n9. Preservation of Combat Effectiveness of Own Troops .  Routing the enemy is not\nenough if one’s own combat  effectiveness does not remain high enough to preserve the fruits of\nvictory.   The Red Alliance  currently sees 4 solutions to this problem :\na. Maximum use of offensive action.\nb. Concealment, deception and disinformation are now considered crucial.\nc. The Restoration of Combat Effectiveness after devastating strikes is a great\nconcern.\nd. The Red Alliance  has devised a logistics system which is designed to cope with fast\nmoving, manoeuvre -dominated operations where there are no clearly defined front lines or\nsafe rear areas.\n10. Pre-emption .  Combining elements of manoeuvrism with the traditional Soviet approach of\nusing shock armies to overrun an ill -prepared enemy, pre -emption has recently been adopted by\nthe Red Alliance  as a principle of war.  They may therefore be expected to act offensively before\nother means might be considered to be exhausted thereby surprising the enemy, inducing shock\nand confusion through the use of the unexpected\n.\nEdition  4 \n1-2-1 SECTION 2: JOINT INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISSANCE  (ISR)  \n11. Joint Assets .  In the air and maritime domain , commanders will have a significant number \nof their own dedicated Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) \nassets though they will still rely on Joint assets for completion of the Recognised Air and Maritime \nPictures (RAP and RMP).  Most of a tactical land formation’s intelligence on the situation in its \nzone of general reconnaissance will come from higher formations.  At divisional and regiment level, \nformations will be direct recipients of the relevant product  of operatio nal reconnaissance.  \na. Satellites .  The Red Alliance  deploys  operational strategic surveillance satellites.  \nUsing electro -optical, infra -red line scan (IRLS), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) , and radar \nand radio intercept sensors, these have an all -weather, day and night capability and, \ncombined with relay satellites, report in near -real time.  The deep coverage  of satellites \nenables the Red Alliance  to make full use of the reach of long -range  Surface to Surface \nMissiles (S SM) and cruise missiles.  Mobile ground stations for receiving and  processing \ndata are now deployed down to divisional level . \nb. Unmanned Aerial Systems .  Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)  are used to \npenetrate into areas where air defences are known to be  dense: not only is a pilot thus not \nput at risk, but the small size of the platform  reduces its detectability and vulnerability.  Air \nForces operate the Shahed 129A  UAS with a n endurance of 24 hrs  and a range of 540 km.  \nWith their  real-time reporting capability, these multi -sensor UAS can be used not only  for \noperational reconnaissance but as  the eyes of Reconnaissance Strike Complexe s (RSC)1 \nat army  level using SS -21 Scarab -B (Tochka ) tactical ballistic missiles , and at the joint level \nusing cruise m issiles and operational SSMs as the strike component.  Such UAS also \nprovide post -strike reconnaissance to  aid the Battle Damage Assessment ( BDA) process.  \nc. Manned Aircraft .  Aircraft are more  responsive than satellites.  They have a longer \nrange and faster transit time  to the target than UAS and are not, like the latter, vulnerable to \njamming of  the link with the ground controller.   The Red Alliance  Air Commander will have \naccess to the SU -24MR Fencer reconnaissance aircraft  and reconnaissance pods may \nattached to other aircraft.  \nd. SIGINT .  Although satellites and aircraft are now the main tactical Signals  \nIntelligence (SIGINT) collectors at the operational level, the Joint Force Commander  (JFC) \nhas substantial numbers of ground -based D irection Finding (DF)  and intercept troops.  \ne. Special Purpose Forces (SPF) .  The Red Alliance  JFC has a formation  of SPF  \nwhich operate in a similar manner to western Special Forces .  Ideally at least some of the \ndeep reconnaissance patrols  formed from these troops will be inserted covertly before \nhostilities begin.   Otherwise,  they may be deployed by parachute (often using a high -\naltitude,  low-opening technique), by helicopter, by microlight  (a favoured method) or  by \nground infiltration.  \n \n \n1 RSC – Recce -Strike Complex.  Precision weapons linked to a (usually  dedicated) reconnaissance system \nproviding real -time target data  to a largely automated control  / fusion centre which selects targets  and \norgan ises near -real time engagement . \nEdition 4 \n1-3-1 SECTION 3 – OPERATIONS IN THE LAND ENVIRONMENT  \nRECONNAISSANCE  \n12. Land Forces – Divisional  Assets . \na. UAS  Company .  The long -range platoon has 3 UAS with a range of  70 km  (ie, a \nround trip totalling 14 0 km ) and an endurance of over 2 hours,  while the short -range \nplatoon has 3 UAS with a range of 30  km and an  endurance of only one hour.  Both are \nsteerable by the ground station and  relay real -time camera pictures.  These are used \nprimarily for general  reconnaissance and not for target acquisition purposes: the artillery \nregiment  has its own UAS battery for targeting, designation of targets for laser -guided  \nprojectiles (air as well as artillery delivered) and B attle Damage Assessment . \nb. Mechan ised Companies .  The 2 or 3 mechan ised (ie, BMP  infantry fighting \nvehicle ) companies  of the reconnaissance battalion may either operate as company -sized  \nreconnaissance groups (RG) or be broken down into platoon -sized  reconnaissance patrols \n(RP).  Mechan ised reconnaissance will operate right  across the formation front up to a \ndepth of 5 0 km  and to the flanks as well in  fluid situations where flanks are open.   All \nplatoons  have laser designators to provide terminal guidance for P recision Guided Missile \n(PGM)  attacks on  high value targets they encounter.  They also possess battlefield \nsurveillance  radars with a range of up to 2 5 km . \nc. The Long -range Reconnaissance Company .  Deep Reconnaissance  Patrols \n(DRPs) from this company operate  in greater depth up to 10 0 km , to observe and target \nkey terrain or high value assets . \nd. The Radio and Radar DF and Intercept Company .  The SIGINT company  can \nintercept,  and direction find H igh Frequency  (HF) groundwave stations out to about  80 km, \nand V ery High Frequency (VHF)  to between 30 and 80 km (low / high power and \ndepending on terrain  masking).  VHF DF may sometimes be good enough to target M ulti-\nBarrelled Rocket Launchers .  It is certainly good enough to direct other reconnaissance \nmeans to refine the  intelligence gained, or to direct raids or perhaps air strikes.  Radar DF \ncan be effective out to 5 0 km , depending on  terrain screening, and location will often be \naccurate enough to target a  MBRL strike.  The Red Alliance ’s main Electronic Intelligence \n(ELINT ) interest is in air defence and  airborne radars.  The ELINT provided by ground \nintercept is vital to the  operations of aviation  assets . \n13. Land Forces – Regimental  Assets .  Tank and motor rifle regiments have  a \nreconnaissance company  with battlefield surveillance radar s.  The company can deploy 2 \nreconnaissance patrols  to cover  the regiment’s front which usually operate 10 to 15  km in front of \nthe unit ’s advance guard . \n14. Land Forces – Battalion  Assets .  All battalions now have an organic reconnaissance \nplatoon  with a BRM -3K reconnaissance vehicle (with radar ).  Battalions may deploy a variety of \nreconnaissance groupings.   A scout vehicle on the axis of advance is the absolute minimum, and \nas the  battalion approaches the enemy a Forward Patrol (FP) will usually form part of  the march \nsecurity grouping.  In mobile battles  a Combat Reconnaissance  Patrol (CRP) will be formed.  \nWhen the terrain or tactical situation demands  it 2 or even  3 patrols may be formed from one \nbattalion.   These CRPs are made up of BMP  infantry fighting vehicle s and tanks  and are the key \nindicator that the main body is close behind.  \n15. Other Land Force Reconnaissance Assets . \na. Air.  Divisions have Mi 17 Hip transport helicopter s attached  from the Air Force’s \nArmy Cooperation Squadrons which may be employed in the reconnaissance role.  \nb. Engineer .  It is common practice to reinforce reconnaissance patrols with  an \nengineer element.  The divisional engineer battalion has a  reconnaissance platoon and the \nregiment’s engineer company can provide  scouts as well.  In addition , Engineer \nReconnaissance Patrols (ERPs) may  be despatched to examine major obstacles or \nimportant routes in detail.  \nEdition 4 \n1-3-2 c. Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence (CBRN) .  All sub -units \nare responsible for continuous monitoring of their own  CBRN  state.  In addition , divisional \nand regimental chemical defence subunits  can provide specialist reconnaissance teams.  \nThey may operate from  their own reconnaissance vehicles (BRDM -RKh or RKhM) or travel \nin a patrol’s vehicles.   Any reconnaissance patrol may have a chemical reconnaissance \nelement  attached and additional chemical patrols will be dispersed through unit  columns to \nevaluate enemy strikes.  \nd. Artillery .  Each artillery battalion has 2 battlefield surveillance radars with  a range \nof 25  to 30 km.  The most important target acquisition means are,  however, found in the \nregimental reconnaissance battalion.  This has a radar  platoon equipped with battlefield \nsurveillance radars and, more significantly  the Z oopark  system which can locate artillery \nand mortars accurately  enough for counter -battery purposes.  The P ole Dish radar DF \nequipment  can be used to target enemy radars (especially air defence rada rs).  The Sterkh \nUAS, with a range of 5 0 km , can provide real -time imagery of any  potential artillery target \nand provide laser designation for engagement with  artillery or air delivered laser -homing \nprojectiles.  A sound ranging platoon  is still held as well, though its value is limi ted in highly \nmobile operations.  One, or more usually several , of these systems are linked by a \ndedicated Command and Control ( C2) / fusion centre to an artillery  battalion to form a \ntactical R econnaissance Fire Complexes (RFC) . \n16.

Admin Moves: Rates of March .  Red Alliance  land formations train to achieve daily \nadministrative  march rates of up to 35 0 km , sustain this for 4  to 5 days and then  enter battle with \nonly a day’s pause.  Of course , most, and ideally all of each  march stage should be completed \nduring darkness or bad weather to aid  concealment.   The table below shows rates f or a march of \n10 to 12 hours  out of 24 hours : \n \nColumn Type  Paved Roads  Dry, Dirt Roads  Muddy, Hilly, Urban Roads  \nMixed  200 to 300 km 120 to 240 km 80 to 140 km \n \n18. Tactical Marches .  The tactical march will begin in an assembly area (see Page 1 -3-5) \nwhere formations, units and sub -units re -organise themselves from the order in which they \ncompleted their administrative march.  A divisional waiting area will occupy an area of 150  to 200 \nkm2  in woods and 400(+) km2 in the open.  \na. The new march order will be determined by the mission, the terrain through which \nthe march will take place and the nature of the enemy threat.  Formations must flow \nsmoothly and quickly from the march into battle in pre -formed groupings tailored for combat \nagainst the expected enemy.  \nb. Once in the combat zone, stronger march security is deployed .  This includes an \nadvance guard (with forward patrols) , a rear guard, and flank detachments marching \nparallel on the  exposed flank.  See the layout o n Page 1-3-6. \nc. Forward detachments may be formed in readiness to conduct deep battle.  If a \nmeeting battle, attack against an ill -prepared or over -extended enemy, or pursuit is \nanticipated, the first echelon will normally be tank heavy at both tactical and operational \nlevels and forward detachments will probe ahead.  The army artillery and rocket artillery \ngroups (AAG and AGRA) will usually move in the first echelon so that their deployment is \nnot hampered and delayed: in the same way, the Division Artillery Groups (DAG) w ill often \nmove at the front of a division’s main body.  \nd. At both operational and tactical levels, anti -tank reserves and mobile obstacle \ndetachments will move on a threatened flank or forward within the main body and ready to \ndeploy to either flank. Second echelons and CPs will normally move on the main axis at \neither level.  \n19. Average Speed of March of Unopposed Columns (km/h) . \n \n \nColumn Type  Paved Roads  Dry, Dirt Roads  Muddy, Hilly, Urban Roads  \nDay Night  Day Night  Day Night  \nMixed  20 to 30 14 to 20 15 to 20 12 to 15 10 to 12 9 to 12 \n \nNote that these rates are for unopposed movement. The average rate of advance for an opposed  \nformation is 15  to 20 km per day in unrestricted (or normal) terrain and 10  to 15 in restricted (ie low \nmountainous or other difficult going ) terrain .  These calculations assume that the attacker can \nconstantly maintain the force ratio of 4: 1.  \n20. Routes .  A division will advance in a zone 25 km wide on 2  to 3 routes with up to 2 reserve \nroutes.  A regiment will usually march on 2 routes preferably with a 1 reserve route . \n21. Intervals and Road Space  occupied by Formations .  The standard interval \nbetween vehicles within columns is 25 -50m, with 100m between companies and 3 -5km \nbetween battalion and other packets within a Regiments  main body  and 5 -10km \nEdition 4 \n1-3-4 separating regimental sized groupings . A regiment in tactical march formation on one \nroute will normally occupy 60 -100km of road space (depending on whether or not it \ndeploys an advanced guard). A division will require up to 240km on each of 2 -3 routes \n(with a total road space requirement for u p to 480km). These figures of course exclude \nreconnaissance elements and any forward detachment that may have been deployed. \nThey also assume that proper intervals are observed, which is often not the case.  \n22. Order of March  \na. Division .  A division will move on a main and secondary axis with a flank \ndetachment.  The bulk of the  artillery and manoeuvre forces will be found on the main axis, \nas will most combat  and service support.  A tank division will usually employ its  separate \ntank battalion as a forward detachment.  Page 1-3-5 illustrate s a tank division  in tactical \nmarch columns.   Combined arms groupings based on Engineer units provide Movement \nSupport Detachments (MSDs) to improve the axis of advance .  These mobility support \nengineers can clear obstacles and lay  bridges.  \nb. Regiment .  Page 1 -3-6 show s motor rifle regiments acting in both the first and \nsecond echelons.  The difference between them lies  principally in the strength of the march \nsecurity and reconnaissance deployed , and in the relegation of the artillery and anti -tank to \nthe rear of the column in the  latter.  \nc. Battalion .  See Page 1 -3-7 for the layout of battalions acting in various roles.  \nList of Diagrams : \nPage 1-3-5 Tank Division Tactical March Formation.  \nPage 1-3-6 Regiment al Tactical  March . \nPage 1-3-7 Basic Force Battalion Tactical March Formation.  \n  \nEdition 4 \n1-3-5   \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-6   \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-7   \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-8 LAND FORCES – OFFENSIVE OPERATION S \n23. Army Offensive Operations .  Generally speaking , Combined Arms Armies are used t o \nconduct penetrations, to act on secondary sectors, to operate in difficult terrain or to form second \nechelons or reserves.  Tank armies usually act in the second echelon when attacking a strong \nenemy, or as the operational exploitation echelon.  There are basically 4 forms of offensive \noperation, though elements of them may be combined : \na. The Single Thrust .  This is most common when the enemy defence is strong, well \nprepared and deeply echeloned.  In these circumstances most of the army’s strength has to \nbe concentrated on a narrow sector to achieve a breakthrough, widen the penetration \nsector to permit the insertion of operational manoeuvre forces.  \nb. Encirclement .  An army is too small to execute an encirclement of operational \nscale by itself.  There may, however, be opportunities, particularly when launching a \ncounter -attack , to eliminate a badly balanced enemy grouping.  \nc. An Attack  from One Flank .  A variation on the theme of encirclement is the \ncrushing of the enemy against an obstacle.  In coastal  operations, where the obstacle is the \nsea, annihilation will be complete , particularly when maritime fires are employed to project \nforce from the sea against the enemy formation .  The concentrated attack  from one flank is \nalso used to encircle a much larger enemy grouping in cooperation with the forces of \nanother army formation, or to turn the position of the main enemy grouping so that it can be \ndestroyed in flank and rear attacks.  \nd. Offensive on Several Axes .  Two or more rupturing attack s may be delivered to \nachieve the disintegration of the enemy grouping, splitting it up into isolated pockets.  This \nsort of operation can be undertaken when the enemy’s defence is hasty, over -extended, \nlacking in depth and without  a strong reserve.  It is also the most appropriate model when \nthe enemy is quite strong but has chosen to adopt manoeuvre defence rather than try and \nhold forward.  \n24. Differing Requirements for Concentration .  In the offensive a numerical superiority of \nbetween 3:1 and 4:1 is considered acceptable on operationally decisive axes.  At the tactical level \nin the land domain, much will depend on the circumstances of the battle.  Attacking a strong \nenemy in prepared defences on an axis of main effort requires a superiority of between  5:1 and 6:1 \nto ensure success.  In a meeting battle, an advantage of 1.5:1 is considered adequate and even \nparity may be accepted.  \n25. Attack Echelons .  The Red Alliance  will echelon forces at the operational level (with CAAs \nforming 1st and 2nd operational echelons) and at the tactical level (with divisions forming 1st and 2nd \ntactical echelons).  Against a world class enemy heavy division deployed on a 30 km front with a \ndepth of 50 km, the Red Alliance  sees the need to deploy a deeply echeloned attack .  Attack \nechelons are formed to break through the enemy’s tactical zone of defence and defeat the \nenemy’s immediate operational reserves.  Thereafter, they continue the advance into the enemy’s \ndepth.  \na. The First Operational Echelon .  The first operational echelon conducts the first \nmission of the operation: the penetration of the defence.  The bulk of the formation will be \nlocated in the first echelon.  Its task is to defeat the enemy’s corresponding first echelon \n(the immediate mis sion) and develop the offensive into his depth (subsequent mission).  If \nthe senior commander’s calculations have been done properly, the first echelon should be \ncapable of penetrating to the entire tactical depth of the defenc e before additional forces \nhave to be committed to maintain momentum.  \nb. The Second Operational Echelon .  The second operational echelon, if formed, is \ntasked with augmenting the efforts of the first.  Its role is to develop the success achieved \nby the first echelon on the main axis.  Thus, it may: conduct pursuit; breach defence zones \nin the depth; defeat counter -attack groupings (ideally d estroying them in meeting battles \nthrough flank and rear attacks); destroy by -passed ‘islands of resistance’ which threaten \nthe development of the operation or unduly restrict deployment and limit the operational \nEdition 4 \n1-3-9 flexibility of the higher formation.  Only when resistance is unexpectedly effective will the \nsecond echelon replace the first.  That implies fighting the first echelon to a standstill and \nthen suffering an operational pause: 2 cardinal crimes in the Red Alliance  military lexicon.  \nNote that the Red Alliance  will reinforce success, applying second echelon pressure to the \nmost successful first echelon attack.  \nc. The Exploitation Echelon .  The exploitation echelon may have to complete the \npenetration of the tactical zone of defence if time would otherwise be lost.  Ideally, \nhowever, it is committed through a clear breach or gap in the enemy’s deployment or, \nperhaps, infiltrated through in  small packets and reunited in the enemy’s rear.  Its role is the \nconversion of tactical into operational success.  The exploitation echelon, working in close \ncooperation with air -delivered forces, collapses the defence from within.   By attacking the \ncommand and control, long -range weapons and logistical support of the enemy’s first \nechelon, and by engaging the operational reserves and seizing depth defence lines before \nthey can be occupied, they help to precipitate the collapse of t he defence.   \nd. Echelon Changes . In line with the RA Principle of War; Offensive Action – maintain \nconstant pressure and tempo.  It is assessed that  when a 1st Tac Echelon reaches 50% \ncombat effectiveness the 2nd Tac Echelon will be committed to carry on the attack and \nbecome the exploitation echelon.  The 1st Tac Echelon will then regenerate or rehabilitate.  \n26. Main Effort .  A formation on the commander’s main effort can expect to be reinforced by \nadditional strike assets, for example elements of the R egimental Artillery Group (RA G), DAG or \nAAG, by combat aviation, and by additional engineer effort and extra air defence  assets . \n \nNote: All Red Alliance  units and formations can be split into echelons.  An echelon is a name given \nto the organisation of formations at each level of command from lower tactical level to operational \nformations.  \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-10 26. Developing the Deep Battle .  For strategic goals to be achieved in good time, it is \nnecessary from the earliest moment to develop deep battle, using forward, raiding and heliborne  \ndetachments, and then, as a result of successful tactical manoeuvre , to conduct deep operations \nwith OMGs working in concert with air and airborne assault forces  (when air defences are weak) . \na. Missiles .  Army Surface to Surface Missile regiment s will always remain under \narmy  or JFC  control for the conduct of the deep fire battle.  Formations on key operational \naxes will be reinforced with SSM formations from the JFC.  The missiles will be the basis of \nthe main Reconnaissance  Strike Complexes.   Land Attack Missiles could be fired from \nships and submarines but no vessels are believed currently to fitted with this capability.  \nb. Artillery .  Strong army artillery groups  will be formed, with organic long -range  \nassets being augmented from the JFC’s  resources.  Usually there will also be an  army  \ngroup of rocket artillery  and maritime fires (naval gunfire support) may be available close to \nthe c oast.  These groups deploy  over considerable areas but their central ised control \nensures the  concentration of fire on the main sector .  This and the rapid manoeuvre of \nmassed  fire in support of the penetration and committal of second or exploitation  echelons , \nas well as the effective waging of the deep fire struggle , is critical to the winning of fire \nsuperiorit y.  The importance of the role of artillery can be gauged from the fact  that the Red \nAlliance  expects up to 40  to 45 % of the destruction visited on the  enemy in the tactical \nzone to be inflicted by it.  \nc. Aviation .  Attack helicopter s and ground attack aircraft  are normally held under the \ncentral ised control  of the Air Commander reflecting the increasing preference for joint \noperations within a single, unified command .  They are likely to be employed together in \nlarge mixed raids against the enemy’s operational -tactical depth, supported  by the \nsuppression of enemy air defence s by missiles, artillery, aviation and ECM.  Elements may \nalso be placed under command of forward or raiding detachments, forming land -air \ngroupings.  Their other r ole is to provide flexible, rapid reacting fire support for the contact \nbattle.  The Red Alliance  expects aviation to account for up to 40  to 45 % of the destruction \nvisited upon the enemy in the tactical zone.  Support  helicopter s are used to deliver \nheliborne assault but can also be used in the attack helicopter role.  \nd. Special Purpose Forces .  SPF are used for reconnaissance , target designation \nand sabotage.  Each a rmy has a n SPF  battalion and each division has a n SPF  company \nwithin the organic reconnaissance  battalion.  \ne. Heliborne and Airborne Operations .  The organic separate light motor rifle \nbattalions are well trained in heliborne assault  to secure deep tactical objectives or conduct \nraids.  At army level, the air assault  battalion , mounted in BMD  airborne infantry fighting \nvehicles , might expect to seize  and hold ground in the operational depth for between 18 \nand 24 hours if well supported by attack helicopters and ground attack aircraft.  Airborne \n(parachute) insertion is usually a strategic operation at regimental strength 150  to 300 km \ndeep.  These forces are often held as a strategic reserve.  \n27. Dimensions of an Army Offensive .  The following generali sations are the broadest of \nguidelines only:   \na. Width .  The sector of responsibility of a main axis formation of 4  or 5 divisions is \nlikely to be 100  to 120 km  in ‘normal ’ conditions.  On secondary sectors, or sectors where \nthe enemy’s force density is inadequate to create any effective defence, the frontage may \ngrow to 120 to150 km  or even more.  Penetration sectors are as little as 10  to16 km for 2 \ndivisions.  \nb. Depth .  The depth of a first echelon army’s immediate mission will normally be \nabout 100  to 120 km  (ie, the depth of a defending corps).  Against a strong, well prepared \ndefence, however, it could shrink to 80  to100 km .   \n28. Rates of Advance and Duration .  On the main axis, the Red Alliance  usually plans on \nachieving an average rate of advance of 15 to 20 km per day in ‘normal ’ (unrestricted) terrain and \n10 to 15 in low mountainous or other difficult going  (restricted) .  These calculations assume that \nEdition 4 \n1-3-11 the attacker can constantly maintain the force ratio of 4:1 which is required to achieve such high \nrates.  \n29. Scale of the Offensive . \n(Distances in km) Division  Regiment  Battalion  \nZone of Advance  20 to 30 Km Up to 10  Km 2 to 3 Km \nAttack Frontage  6 to 8 Km 3 to 4 Km 1 to 1.5 Km \nDepth of Immediate \nObjective  20 to 25 approx depth \nof 1st echelon  \nregiment  6 to 8 approx depth of \n1st echelon  defence  \nbattalion  2 to 3 approx depth of \n1st echelon  defence  \ncompany  \nDepth of subsequent \nObjective  50 to 60 approx depth \nof 1st echelon  division  20 to 25 approx depth \nof 1st echelon  \nregiment  6 to 8 approx depth of \n1st echelon  defence  \nbattalion  \nFigures given here are for an attack on a prepared, positional defence  and will vary according to \ntask, enemy strength, terrain  and the organization for the attack (eg, level of reinforcement).  \n30. RED  Land Forces  - Forms of Tactical Manoeuvre . \n \n31. Types of Attack .  The Red Alliance  defines types of attack in terms of the enemy’s tactical \nposture.  \na. Attack from a Position of Close Contact .  This attack is conducted by a force \nalready in close contact with the enemy  in a strongly defended position .  It is characterised \nby detailed reconnaissance  and heavy artillery  preparation followed by an assault on a \nnarrow front.  The Red Alliance  believes it will be less frequent than attacks from the march \nin future war.  \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-12 b. Meeting Battle .  A meeting engagement is conducted when 2 attacking forces \nmove towards each other.  This form of attack is characterised by surprise, little knowledge \nof the enemy situation and the need for quick decision making.  It is normally conducted \nduring a tactical march or following a breakthrough against enemy reserves moving \nforward.   The Red Alliance  believes that this will be the most common form of combat on \nthe manoeuvre -dominated, ever -changing battlefield of the next war.  As the Red Allia nce \nunit advances in tactical march formation, the action in a meeting battle usually follows the \nsequence below.  \n(1) Location and Identification of an Approaching Enemy .  One of the first \nreactions of the Red Alliance  commander will be to direct his own reconnaissance \nassets to provide more detail of the enemy’s location, strength, movements and  \nintentions.  \n(2) Selection of the Point of Contact .  The Red Alliance  commander will \nassess the locations of the opposing forces and their speed of advance and  will plot \nthe likely line of contact on his map.  From a map assessment he determines the \nlocation of the key terrain in that area.  It is vital to seize  this ground before the \nenemy and this task may be allocated to a forward detachment or to leading march \nsecurity elements.  It may be necessary to slow the enemy down .  Remote mining \nand / or air attack may be used to accomplish this, as may the actions of a forward \ndetachment.  \n(3) Engagement of the Enemy .  Precision air, long -range artillery and remote \nmining attacks will be delivered against the approaching enemy .  Speed and shock \naction are paramount.  The forward march security elements will occupy a blocking \nposition and begin engaging the approaching forces.  Attached artillery will also \ndeploy as rapidly as possible and open fire.  Anti-tank elements should be well \nforward in the march formation so that they may join in the task of pinning the \nenemy force.  The main body should deploy to the selected assault position without \ndelay and strike the enemy’s main body as it advances to support its forward \nelements.   Ideally the enemy is then distracted and assaulted while on the move or \ndeployin g, preferably from a flank or even both flanks.  \nc. Pursuit .  A pursuit is mounted against withdrawing enemy forces.  The Red Alliance  \nwill attempt to maintain pressure on the enemy to slow the withdrawal.  Attempts will be \nmade to encircle and destroy the enemy.  The Red Alliance  may use air assault troops to \nestablish blocking positions along the withdrawal route and use fast moving units on \nparallel routes to overtake withdrawing enemy.  \nd. Attack from  the Line of March .  An attack from the line of march may be  \nconducted from the tactical march and when not in contact with the enemy prior to the \nattack.   It is normally conducted against enemy in a hasty defence position.  The Red \nAlliance  frontage will narrow on approach to the enemy position to maximise chances of a \nbreakthrough.  \n(1) Page 1-3-14 shows a division attacking from the line of march alongside a \nregiment .  The 2 attacking formations start from dispersed assembly areas.  They \nwill converge on the assault sector as late as possible.  The breakthrough of the first \nechelon will take place on a narrow frontage, but boundaries will widen again for \naction in the enemy’s depth.  The main attack is mounted by a motor rifle regiment \nin 2 echelons.  Each battalion in the main attack will also attack in 2 echelons.  The \ndivision has a ta nk regiment in its second echelon.  These forces will help to carry \nthe battle through to the depth of the defending divisions on a widening frontage \nafter the forward regiment s are defeated.  \n(2) Direct fire support will be given by the troops already in contact, probably \naugmented by elements temporarily detached from the A nti-Tank Reserves (ATR) .  \nBoth first echelon regiments will form RAGs with artillery decentral ised from \ndivision.  \nEdition 4 \n1-3-13 (3) Page 1-3-15 shows a Motor Rifle  Regiment in the attack.  \n(4) Page 1 -3-16 shows the layout of a Motor Rifle  Battalion in the attack.  \n32. Objectives .  An objective is more akin to a NATO Phase Line rather than a point target and \nhence will normally follow a linear terrain feature whenever possible.  An en emy commander’s \nintention is focused primarily on destroying an enemy who may stop him from reaching his \nobjective.  Once an objective is achieved an attacking force is expected to continue for as long as \nit is combat effective (CE).  At the tactical level commanders give their subordinates an \nIMMEDIATE and SUBSEQUENT objective.   If the subsequent objective is achieved a CE unit is \ngiven a direction in which to advance . \n33. Echelons .  Red Alliance  land forces will attack in 2 echelons at each level: tactical and \noperational, ie 1st tactical echelon and the  2nd tactical echelon of the 1st operational echelon.  The \n1st echelon contains 1/2 to 2/3 of the echelon combat power, with the remainder in the 2nd \nechelon.  The first echelon mission is to achieve the immediate objective.  If achieved, the 2nd may \nbe tasked with the subsequent objective with the 1st reverting to a reserve.  The Red Alliance  uses \nsingle  echelon formations w hen the enemy is not defending in depth or when attacking along a \nsecondary axis.  It will commit the 2nd echelon only to reinforce success, not to replace  the 1st \nechelon.  If committed , the 2nd echelon will move through gaps between the 1st echelon or around \na flank; forward passage of lines is rarely used and will be avoided whenever possible.  When \ncommitted the 2nd echelon is supported by artillery , air and smoke.  The 2nd echelon is also used \nas a counter attack force, to destroy by passed enemy or to  conduct a pursuit.  \n34. Distance Between  Echelons (km) . \n \nPhase of Battle  Sub to Unit, Unit and Formation  \nBattalion  Regiment  Division  \nDuring the 1st Echelon  Penetration  3 to 5 10 to 15 20 to 30 \nJust Before Entry into Battle  1.5 to 2 3 to 5 10 to 15 \n \n35. Criteria for Success  in Attack .  Three indicators are used to assess the success of an  \noperation:  \n• the degree of destruction inflicted on the enemy  \n• the depth of  penetration achieved  \n• and the degree to which the fighting power of the formation  is preserved, at least on the \nmain axis.  \nThe degree of destruction to be imposed  on the enemy is said to be at least 50% of his initial \nstrength and at least 75% of  his high value systems and the ruination of his command -and-control  \nsystem,  for these together will render the enemy combat ineffective. The degree of  penetration \ndemanded will vary according to relative strengths, terrain and other  factors. The third indicator is \nrelative. The ability of the attacker to maintain the  offensive is a function of the loss rates of both \nsides. If the defen der has lost not less than 50% and the attacker not more than 40%, momentum \ncan be maintained: (losses even greater than 40% can be accepted if a slight superiority in \nnumbers remains and the enemy’s morale has been broken.) . The operation is considered a \nsuccess if all three criteria are  met, partially if only the second is achieved and not at all if the \ndepth of penetration  is inadequate.  \n \nList of Diagrams : \nPage 1 -3-14 Motor Rifle Division Attack Against a Prepared Positional Defence.  \nPage 1-3-15 Motor Rifle  Regiment in the Attack.  \nPage 1 -3-16 Motor Rifle  Battalion  Layout in the Attack.  \n  \nEdition 4 \n1-3-14   \nIIMR Division Attack Against a Prepared \nPositional Defence\nXX\nXXII II IIIIIIXX\nIII\nDAG\nAAG\nAGRARAG RAG8M\nSupporting\n Attack5) \nFlank Det\n5A5A5) \n+MOD\nDiv 1st Echelon5) \nDiv ATR\n+MODReserve\n Bde\nX\nII\n6A5A SEP\nReserve(-) (-)_5M _5M _5M _5M \nDiv 2nd Echelon6A SEP5% \nAirMob\nReserveLT\nEdition 4 \n1-3-15  \n  \nMotor Rifle Regiment  In the AttackIIIIIII\nIIIII6M\nSupporting Attack\n5A(-)RAG\nDAG\nI4AResRegt 1st Ech\nRegt 2nd  Ech5)Regt Anti Tank \nReserve & \nMODFlank\nSecurity\n5% Air Mob & Anti \nLanding \nReserve\n(from Div )_5M _5M \nEdition 4 \n1-3-16  \n  \nMR Battalion Attack _5M \n1.5 – 2 Km \n1.5 – 2 Km \n1 – 4 Km Tk Pl Tk Pl Tk Pl Tk Coy HQ\nMR Pl MR Pl MR Pl\nTech Repair\n & Evac Group\nBn Food\nSupply Point MR Coy HQ \nMR Pl MR Pl MR Pl\nMR Coy HQ\nMR PlMR PlMR Pl2nd Ech MR Coy HQ5M\nMortar BtyGren Lchr Pl\nAD Pl\n W\nBn Ammo Point\nBn Fuel Point\nDiagram is not to scale and illustrative of lay downBn Medical Post\n4( 2S1\n4( 4( RAG\nf MG PlCoy AT Pl Coy AT Pl\nCoy AT Pl\n(BMP -2) (BMP -2)(T72A)\n(BMP -2)\n(2S23)\nc(BMP -2)\nEdition 4 \n1-3-17 LAND FORCES – DEFENSIVE  OPERATION S \n36. Types of Defence .  The following types of defence can be hasty or deliberate:  \na. Positional Defence .  Positional defence is the norm when adequate forces are \navailable to achieve an efficient density of  weapons (especially anti -tank) or key  areas must \nbe held .  See Page 1 -3-20 which shows a Motor Rifle  Division  in defence.  A positional \ndefence is designed to be penetrated but only to create the conditions for a decisive \ncounter attack.   The ground will offer relatively few opportunities for the conduct of \npositional defence at the operational level, though some favourable sectors may be held \npositionally in manoeuvre defence to provide a pivot for the manoeuvre of counter -attack \nforces.  \nb. Positional Defence in the Desert .  Defensive positions are based on terrain which \nconstrains flanking moves and channels frontal attacks, ie mountainous areas, \nescarpments, soft sand or salt flats.  Ideally, defences are sited in broken country which \naids concealment and slows the enemy.  Wadis and depressions are exploited to hide and \nprotect both defences and second echelons / reserves, and a good network of roads / \ntracks is desirable for the rapid manoeuvre of the latter.  As in manoeuvre defence, except \non the rare occasion when there  are no flanks to turn, positional defence requires that a \ngood half of a defending formation is deployed in the second echelon / reserve.  The \ncounter -attack, particularly against an enveloping attack, is the critical element in desert \ndefence, on which the stability of the defence rests.  \nRED Frontages and Depths  in Positional Defence  \nSpatial \nScope  Divisional \nZone  Brigade \nZone  Regimental \nSector  Bn Area  Company \nStrongpoint  Platoon \nStrongpoint  \nFrontage  \n \nDepth  20-30 Km \n \n20-30 Km  15-25 Km \n \n15-25 Km  10-15 Km  \n \n10-15 Km  3-5 Km  \n \n3-5 Km  1-1½ Km  \n \nUp to 1 Km  Up to 400m  \n \nUp to 300m  \nNote: These Yardsticks exclude any security zone or forward positions, deployment of a forward detachment \nwould add up to 20km to a Division’s or Brigade’s depth and a forward position up to 6km to that of a \nRegiment or battalion.  Intervals between company strongpoints can be up to 1,000m and between  platoon \nstrongpoints up to 300m . Groupings forced to cover wide frontages will perforce have to deploy in a  single \nechelon with a small reserve and will have to sacrifice depth   \nc. Manoeuvre Defence .  Manoeuvre defence  is intended to econom ise forces on less \nimportant axes and  / or to buy time for the deployment of forces from the depth in order to \ncreate a positional defence in depth or mount a decisive counter attack .  In manoeuvre \ndefence, the aim is to wear down the enemy’s strength and deny him operational \nmomentum by defending on successive, deeply echeloned lines but refusing to become \ndecisively engaged on any of them.  \nRED Frontages and Depths in Manoeuvre  Defence  for each Delay Position  \nSpatial \nScope  Divisional \nZone  Brigade \nZone  Regimental \nSector  Bn Area  Company \nStrongpoint  \nFrontage  \n \nDepth  40-45 Km  \n \n10-15 Km  30-35 Km  \n \n10-15 Km  15-20 Km  \n \n4-10 Km  7-10 Km  \n \n2-5 Km  1½ - 3 Km  \n \nUp to 1 Km  \nNote: By sacrificing depth and thereby taking considerable risks with the stability  of the defence, these \nfrontages could be extended by up to 50% down to battalion  level The depth given here is that on each delay \nposition. The total depth of a  formation’s delaying battle could be 50 -60km (in a typical covering force \nmission),  up to 150km or more in the event of the enemy achieving strategic or operational  surprise in \nmounting an offensive.  \n \nEdition 4 \n1-3-18 d. Manoeuvre Defence in the Desert .  Wide sectors and the inevitability of open \nflanks and / or gaps in deployment make manoeuvre defence the most common form of \naction in deserts.  Ideally, half or more of each formation and, where possible each units as \nwell, is held in the second echelon / reserve.  By exploiting the limitation of the roads / \ntracks network, areas of poor -going an d mining conducted by Mobile Obstacle \nDetachments (MODs), the first echelon will try to catch the enemy in fire pockets and \nambushes.  Then, taking advantage of the enemy’s losses and disruption, counter -attacks \nwill be mounted by the second echelon to des troy him or, at least, to inflict further \ncasualties, to delay and to enable  the Red Alliance  to extricate his own defending \nelements.  The Red Alliance  is well aware of the temptation towards dispersing the \ndefensive effort (and its dangers), particularly at the operational level.  Very strong forces \nmust be kept in hand to meet the enemy’s main effort, which will almost always consist of a \nsweep round a n open flank to encircle defending formations.   A Tank Regiment in Defence \nis shown on Page 1 -3-21. \n37. Terminology and Concepts used in Operational and Tactical Defence . \na. Covering Forces .  A Covering Force is organised at Joint Force or army level.  It \nwill comprise 1  to 2 lower formations, deployed up to 50 to 60 km in front of the Main \nDefensive Area.  On conclusion of its delaying task, the covering force will fall back into the \nsecond echelon or reserve and carry out refurbishment.  Its roles are : \n(1) To determine the composition and strength of the attacker, his chosen axes \nand intentions.  \n(2) To force the enemy into premature deployment on successive delay lines \nthus winning time for the organization of the main defences and counter moves.  \n(3) To force the enemy to concentrate and thus offer a rich target array for \ndeep -strike weapons (including aviation).  \n(4) To channel the enemy into the strongest part of the main defences \n(especially fire pockets); wear down and disrupt the attacker; conceal the true \nlocation of the forward edge.  \nb. Types of Covering Forces .  The types of c overing forces found at the tactical level \nare: \n(1) Forward Detachment .  A Forward Detachment is an all arms grouping \norgan ised at army or divisional level and only when there is no covering force out in \nfront.  The forward detachment is pushed up to 20  km in front of the forward edge , \ninto a Security Zone , and will delay on 2  to 3 lines before reverting to formation \nreserve or second echelon for refurbishment.   Page 1 -3-22 shows a typical layout.  \n(2) Forward Positions .  Forward Positions are composed of a reinforced \ncompany in strength, deployed 3  to 6 km beyond the forward edge on the most \nthreatened axis for their parent unit.  \n(3) Combat Security Outposts .  A unit commander may well order that a \nsecond echelon company temporarily detach es a platoon to form a combat security \noutpost up to 2  km in front of the forward edge on an approach not cover ed by a \nforward position.  \nc. Combat Support in the Security Zone .  Each battalion acting in the first  echelon \nof a covering force will have at least one , and usually 2, artillery  battalions in direct support , \nand is likely to receive C lose Air Support  at critical moments .  There will be other long -\nrange artillery , Multi Barrelled Rocket Launchers  and target acquisition means deployed in \nthe zone.   Together with air attack, the artillery battalion’s role is to wear down and disrupt \nthe enemy long before he  reaches the forward edge  of the Main Defensive Area .  Strong air \ndefence groups will be formed to protect deep fire groups, HQs and logistic support against \nair, missile and heliborne  / airborne attacks.  \nEdition 4 \n1-3-19 d. Counter A ttacks .  Counter attacks are considered to be the decisive moment in \ndefence and all available resources will be committed to them. This is the main function of \nthe second echelon, which will be armour heavy. Fire support will come from the Divisional \nArtillery Groups (DAG) of both first and second echelon divisions and the Army Artillery \nGroup (AAG). Air and MBRL strikes, with EW, will neutral ise the enemy fire support and \nHQs. Remote mining will impose delay on armoured reserves.  \nDEFENDED AREAS  \n38. The Main Defensive Area (MDA) .  The MDA is an area in which every effort will be made \nto halt and destroy the enemy.  It consists of defensive belts to canalise the enemy into the \nstrongest positions and killing areas.  Only the front positions will be occupied initially, with units \nfalling back to depth positions later.  Forces are usually deployed in 2 echelons, with second \nechelon divisions 20 to 30 km behind the first.  The first echelon will fight a stubborn defence and \nwill rarely mount counter attack s on its own, but his is not a passive defensive battle.  The Red \nAlliance  place great emphasis on the use of reserves in defence. Penetrations will be met by anti -\ntank reserves and MODs which are engineer units equipped to create rapid obstacles.  Anti -\nlanding reserves will respond rapidly to deep air mobile or airborne attacks .  The scale of the \ndefence is shown in the table on Page 1 -3-23. \n39. Defended Areas in the Desert .  Given extensive fields of fire, defended areas are usually \nwider and deeper than on normal terrain.  They are prepared for all -round defence and must be \nable to maintain themselves for long periods without resupply.  Due to the difficulty in achieving \nconcealment, more dummy positions than usual need to be prepared.  Inevitably, there will often \nbe substantial gaps between areas and often between strongpoints within them.  These are \ncovered by surveillance and patrols and may be plugged by remote mining an d artillery fire / attack \nhelicopters and / or by the actions of Anti -Tank Reserves (ATRs) and MODs.  \n40. Position Preparation  in the Desert .  This generally poses considerable problems in \ndeserts.  Digging -in on soft sand is not possible without revetments (fortification); explosive means \nare usually necessary in rocky areas.   There are rarely any locally available materials to be used \nand concealment is also difficult. Positions must be more or less level with the ground and high \nwinds will disturb or ruin camouflage and shift sands to reveal defences and minefields.  \n41. Obstacle Creation  in the Desert .  With few natural obstacles, there is increased emphasis \non anti -tank ditching (on suitable soils) and mining (including the extensive use of dummy \nobstacles for deception and controlled minefields to avoid inhibiting friendly forces’ manoeuvre).  \nTactical  and, especially, protective minefields are important to shape the battle but, given the \nunpredictability of a battle’s development and logistic constraint even more emphasis will be \nplaced on mining during the course of combat by MODs, artillery and aircr aft. Increased resources \nwill be allocated.  \nList of Diagrams  \nPage 1 -3-20 Motor Rifle  Division in Defence  Main Axis . \nPage 1 -3-21 Tank Regiment in Defence.  \nPage 1 -3-22 Variants of a Motor Rifle  Regiment in Defence.  \nPage 1 -3-23 Motor Rifle  Battalion  in Positional Defence . \n  \nEdition 4 \n1-3-20 \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-21 \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-22  \n\nEdition 4 \n1-3-23  \n \n3MMR BN IN POSITIONAL DEFENCE\n3M\n3MCombat\n Security\n Outpost\n3R3M\n3A 3A3M3M\n3M\n3M3M\n600mKilling\nArea\n4(II\nII IIII\n3AReserve4)\nFlank Security\nKey:\nMixed Mine Field\nLinked Trench System\nAnti Tank Ditching\nWire ObstacleCoy\n Strong PointCoy\n Strong Point\n4QIICoy\n Strong Point\nFrontage 3 – 5 KmDepth 2 ½ - 4 Km Up to 2 Km\nEdition 4 \n1-4-1 SECTION 4 – AIR FORCE OPERATIONS  \n40. The Importance of Air Power .  Red Alliance  theorists do not maintain that air power can \nachieve war winning results independently.  The air force has, however, progressed far from its \nprevious status as an auxiliary service, albeit an important one.  The significance of air power has \nincreased dra matically since World War II and it goes on rising.  In future war, victory will be \nimpossible without control of the air, for all combat has become air -land in nature.  Up to 70% of \nthe destruction of ground targets will be inflicted by air -delivered weapons, including up to 45% of \nthose in the tactical zone.  Moreover, the air element has progressed beyond being merely an \nessential component in the combined arms team at both lower and higher formation levels.  It has \nbecome the principal compo nent of some deep operations, accomplishing operational missions \nwith the aid of missile troops and raiding forces.  \n41. Electronic -Fire Superiority .  The first operation in future war, ideally (or rather \nnecessarily) pre -emptive in nature, will consist of an electronic -fire engagement.  This will be an \nair, land and sea launched missile, aviation , electronic and increasingly cyber -attack  throughout \nthe enemy’s operational and even strategic depth to seize the initiative, establish dominance in the \ninformation struggle and the battle for air and fire superiority, thus creating the necessary \npreconditions for the actions of th e ground forces.  The electronic -fire engagement may last for \nseveral weeks and during it there may be only limited offensive activity by major ground \nformations.  \n42. The Struggle for Electronic -Fire Superiority .  The Red Alliance  sees the likelihood of a \nfuture war beginning with an air operation which may assume the dimensions of a campaign.  This \nwill determine which side wins the struggle for electronic -fire superiority at the critical operational \nlevel and therefore, in all pr obability, the outcome of initial operations or even the war as a whole.  \nThe aims of this operation / campaign will be as follows:  \na. The neutral isation of enemy air defences . \nb. The destruction of enemy High Value Air Assets (HVAA) , especially long -range \noffensive aircraft,  and of operational and operational -tactical missile systems and the other  \ncomponents of R econnaissance Strike Complexes.  \nc. The disruption of enemy C3I.  \nd. Having thus secured electronic -fire dominance, hamper the operations  of ground  \nforces by disrupting the enemy’s mobil isation, concentration  and deployment and inflicting \nheavy losses on his ground troops, logistic  support and infrastructure.  \n43. The Characteristics of Air Power .  Air Forces possess certain attributes  which impart to \nthem the principal role in the struggle for electronic -fire superiority and which make them a major \nplayer in all operations.  These are  their tremendous reach, ability to deliver large payloads with \nconsiderable  (often precise) accuracy and their speed of reaction at the operational and  even \ntactical levels.  These qualities give air power the following  characteristics : \na. Flexibility .  Air power can effectively engage many target sets anywhere in the \noperational or tactical zones, and it can rapidly switch its emphasis from area to area or \ntarget set to target set.  \nb. Responsiveness .  Firepower may be manoeuvred very rapidly across the front and \ninto the enemy’s depth.  \nc. Concentration .  Modern aircraft can bring formidable weights of firepower to bear \nas long as they are employed with precision weapons.  \nd. Surprise .  By virtue of its other characteristics, air power is capable of producing a \nsudden, mass concentration of firepower anywhere of interest to the operational \ncommander.  The existence of this capability is known to the enemy, but the where and \nwhen may be surprising, particularly in the sense that it may be difficult to defend against in \nall sectors of importance simultaneously.  \n \nEdition 4 \n1-4-2 PRINCIPLES IN THE USE OF AIR POWER  \n44. General .  In order fully to exploit the characteristics of air power to achieve the greatest \npossible impact on the course of operations and battles, the Red Alliance  has identified certain \nprinciples. These apply equally at its operational and tactical levels, ie to the employment of both \nthe Air Force and Army Aviation.  They are outlined below.  \n45. Concentration and Continuity of Effort .  As far as possible, Air Force resources must be \nconcentrated to achieve the main operational goal.  Initially, this will always be the achievement of \nair (and fire) superiority.  Thereafter, while maintaining control of the air  with whatever assets are \nnecessary, it is likely to be deep interdiction with occasional (but en masse ) diversions into counter \nland operations in support of ground activity  on the main axis or support for air landings.  It is \nconsidered essential to avoid spreading forces too thi nly by pursuing several operational goals \nsimultaneously and thus failing to achieve any of them fully.  It is equally important to avoid \nswitching from one operational objective to another before the first is fully achieved.  Continuity of \neffort is thus stressed.  The same injunction to avoid ‘penny packeting’ applies to the employment \nof Army Aviation in the tactical sphere.  \n46. Centralised Command and Control .  To achieve concentration of effort, it is necessary to \ncentralise command and control.  This also makes it possible rapidly to refocus air effort as the \noperational situation develops.  Exercise of control at the highest possible level is a corollary of \ncentralised command and control.  It ensures that effort will indeed be concentrated on the main \noperational or tactical goal and, at the same time, it guarantees the full exploitation of the flexibility \nthat is characteristic of air  power.  The highest l evel will be determined by the operational \nobjectives and by the range and capabilities of the assets available .  Operational Command \n(OPCOM) of bomber, fighter -bomber, fighter , ground attack  and transport a ircraft will normally be \ndelegated to the Red Alliance  Joint Force  Commande r who, in turn, will delegate OPCOM to his \nAir Commander.  Tactical Command (TACOM) of some battlefield support helicopters may be \ndelegated to the Land Commander whilst TACOM of embarked helicopters will normally be \ndelegated to the Maritime Commander.  \n47. Coordination .  The coordination of force packages and of air actions with those of the \nground forces, air defence and EW is seen to be a complex and  difficult task.  It must be organised \nat the highest practical level.  \n48. Economy of Force .  If concentration and continuity of effort are to be  achieved, air assets \nmust not be used to perform missions which could be  executed by other means.   Thus, for \ninstance, some air defences are better  suppressed by cruise missiles and SSMs, artillery and \nraiding detachments  or SPF than by manned aircraft; reconnaissance and attacks on heavily  \ndefended point targets may better be left to UAS; ground attack aircraft or  attack helicopters are \nnot used to strike targets that can be neutralised  by artillery.  In order to economise on very \nexpensive aircraft and crews and to  free them for offensive action, the Red Alliance  has put much \neffort into increasing  the si ze and effectiveness of the ground forces’ air defence.  The Red \nAlliance  does, however, recognise that a combination of losses amongst  air defenders and rapid \nand frequent moves will create holes in the air  defence umbrella, especially amongst forces \nconducting deep battle and  deep operations.  This may impel the Red Alliance  to provide  top cover \nin some  situations.  When conducting offensive action, economy must be achieved  by ensuring \nthat strikes are coordinated in terms of time and geographical  area to minimi se the effort required \nto suppress enemy air defences and  defeat enemy fighter aviation.  \n49. Surprise .  To reduce attrition rates to acceptable levels, surprise is an  important part of air \naction.  It can be achieved by: choosing unexpected  axes; attacking at an unlikely time; attacking \nin unanticipated strength; using  new weapons and  / or tactics  utilising the entire electronic domain ; \ndegrading enemy early warning capabilities , and deceptive actions (especially by UAS). \n50. Preservation of Combat Effectiveness .  The major contribution made by air power to the \nstruggle for electronic -fire superiority and the immense cost of modern aircraft combine to make \nthis a very important principle.  \na. Defensive Measures .  The Red Alliance  is paying particular attention to the  \nsurvivability of airfields, air defences, EW and reconnaissance assets in  order that aviation \nEdition 4 \n1-4-3 can be preserved long enough to achieve its potential  and gain a decisive superiority over \nthe enemy.  This requires large  numbers of dispersal airfields with hardened aircraft \nshelters (HAS) and  other hardened facilities for vital installations: redundancy in both  \noperating surfaces and air bases themselves is considered vital to  maintaining maximum \nsortie levels.  Rapid runway and taxiway repair are also important and repair parties are \nmaintained at a high state of  readiness and training.  \nb. Deception .  Deception measures to tempt the enemy into expending his  expensive \nand therefore scarce precision weaponry will assume a  particularly important role.  \nc. Offensive Action .  The Red Alliance  believes that offensive action is critical  to \npreserve its ability to conduct deep strikes.  Enemy aviation, both  offensive and defensive, \nmust be attacked on its bases.  In the air, the  effectiveness of enemy command and control \naircraft, including their  associated communications, will be neutrali sed by a combination of \nair and ground jammers working in support of air defence aviation resources  employing \nanti-radiation as well as air to air missiles.  Enemy AWACS,  JSTARs and tanker type \ntargets are very high in priority for destruction,  as are stealth aircraft.  Attempts will also be \nmade to destroy the  communications and navigation satellites on which so much of an  \nenemy’s air effort will depend.  \nMISSIONS  \n51. General .  Red Alliance  long range aviation, missiles and SPF may well be  used to strike \nkey political and military command targets, strategic missiles  and critical economic and \ninfrastructure facilities to achieve strategic impact.   Such missions will be controlled and planned at \nthe highest level.  Details  will be campaign dependent and are not discussed further in an \noperational  and tactical  manual.  The Joint Military Commander will concentrate his air campaign  \non achieving  operational goals, though its intervention in tactical land battles through the provision \nof counter land support to l and actions and counter sea activity at sea will also have a high \nsignificance for air tasking, particularly when the Air Commander is the supporting commander . \n52. Achievement of Electronic -Fire Superiority .  For the Red Alliance , the most  important \ntask is to prevent the enemy from exploiting to the full the  characteristics of his Reconnaissance \nStrike Complexes and air power while allowing his own to be  utilised to the full.   This means that \nmost fixed wing aviation, save for dedicated  ground -attack aircraft, will be devoted for the most \npart to offensive or  defensive counter -air operations until the required degree of control of the air is \nachieved.  A significant part of this struggle for electronic -fire superiority will be the destruction and \ndegradation of the enemy’s C3I,  particularly of the reconnaissance and control elements of RSCs \nand RFCs.   Considerable effort will be devoted to the destruction of enemy  reconnaissance, \nnavigation, communications and meteorological satellites,  AWACS and those aircraft associated \nwith RSCs.  \n53. Deep Interdiction .  The Red Alliance  holds that deep interdiction has the greatest  impact \non the conduct of ground operations in manoeuvre warfare provided,  of course, that the enemy is \nunder heavy pressure from the ground forces.   Thus , the second priority after the achievement of \nair and fire superiority goes  to the destruction, disruption and delay of the movement of enemy \nreserves  and logistic support.  The more fluid and mobile operations become, the more  important \ninterdiction becomes.  The Red Allian ce realises, however, that the  efforts of a deep interdiction \noperation will only be significant if that operation  is conducted continuously over an extended \nperiod and with adequate  resources.  \n54. Counter Land .  Counter land operations are  seen to have a more immediate, but inevitably  \nalso a more locali sed influence on the conduct of ground operations.  It is therefore the main form \nof support for the ground forces only when either an  insufficiently favourable air situation or a lack \nof resources preclude a deep  interdiction operation, or during certain crucial phases of the ground \noperation .  These might be the committal of an OMG or operational second echelon to defeat an  \nenemy counter attack, the forcing of a major obstacle in the enemy’s depth,  to break up an enemy \nattack or to damage and delay a penetration or  exploitation force .  Such interventions in the land \nbattle must, of course, be  closely coordinated with the actions of the ground forces.  The \npreference is  to employ fixed wing aviation against targets outside artillery range, ie for  Air \nInterdiction (AI) missions, and attacks on enemy reserve  concentrations, deep fire systems and \nEdition 4 \n1-4-4 formation C ommand Posts.  CAS is generally left to dedicated units unsuited to deep  strike and to \nattack  helicopters.  \n55. Reconnaissance .  Reconnaissance  is considered a vital mission of the Air Force despite \nthe proliferation of satellites and UAS.  The issue has been addressed in detail  in Chapter 1 \nSection 2 . \n56. Air Assault .  The actions of airborne and air assault troops are key  components of deep \noperation s and battles.  Their employment is utterly  dependent on the achievement of the required \ndegree of control of the air .  The delivery of  these important assets is always preceded and \naccompanied by a major air  effort to eliminate threatening enemy air and air defence elements and \nto neutrali se ground forces which could intervene against the landing.  \n57. Aerial Resupply .  Aerial resupply is routinely practised for the delivery of key items needed  \nin a hurry.  It is also envisaged occasionally on a large scale, when the air  situation allows, to \nsupport forces operating in the enemy depth or encircled  groupings.  \n \nEdition 4 \n1-5-1 SECTION 5 – MARITIME FORCE OPERATIONS  \nINTRODUCTION  \n58. The Red Alliance  maritime forces comprise a mix of Western and former -Soviet platforms, \nsome of which date back some years or were procured through friendly third -party nations as a \nway of overcoming sanctions .  In recent years the Red Alliance  has invested considerably in its \nexpeditionary capabilities with the acquisition of both new and second -hand amphibious and \nsupport shipping .  Along with the acquisition of a number of conventional submarines and major \nsurface combatants, the Red Alliance  maritime forces can now claim to having developed into a \ntrue ‘green water’ force.  In addition, the maritime forces include a very large number of Fast Attack \nCraft (FAC) and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC) suited for more the more traditional c oastal  \noperations of a ‘brown water’ navy.   Within the Red Alliance  as a whole, maritime forces are seen \nas the junior partner and are likely to be employed primarily in support of land forces as part of a \nJoint Force.  \nROLES OF RED ALLIANCE  MARITIME FORCES  \n59. The 4 roles of the Red Alliance  maritime forces are Warfighting, Maritime Security, Peace \nSupport and Defence Engagement.  Primacy lies in warfighting with all units optimised for the \nwarfighting role.   The maritime contribution to security, peace support and defence engagement is \nlimited to that which is seen to promote the interests of the countries of the Red Alliance.  \n60. The Warfighting Role .  The Red Alliance  identifies  2 distinct  and largely separate \nwarfighting functions for its maritime forces.  It recognises firstly that success in the maritime \ndomain  will be delivered through control of the sea, largely delivered by denying its use to its \nenemies.  Secondly, it recognises the importance of maritime power projection through use of its \namphibious capabilities in support of the land campaign.   \n61. Sea Control .  Sea Control is underpinned by maritime manoeuvre and delivered through a \nnumber of operational approaches  which are listed below.  Aircraft in the counter sea role may be \nexpected to support maritime forces in achieving and maintaining sea control.  \na. Sea Denial .  The Red Alliance  will first and foremost seek to deny its enemies the \nfreedom of manoeuvre to operate at sea.  Close to shore it will lay sea mines of which it \nhas vast numbers albeit of antiquated design with most being the traditional type of \nmoored, contact mine.  FAC and FIAC will be deployed in large numbers using ‘swarm’ \ntactics to deny straits and landing grounds , and missile shore batteries will be integrated \ninto the joint plan.  Further out to sea, a Surface Action Group (SAG) compris ing a mix of \nfrigates and destroyers supported by a suitable logistics ship may be deployed as an overt \nshow of force , whilst submarines may be despatched if covert activity is required.  \nb. Fleet in Being .  The simple possession of submarines delivers a real threat to \nenemy maritime forces .  They must expend considerable time and effort to ascertain their \nlocation  and to monitor them even when they are well away from the enemy forces’ \noperating areas.  \nc. Blockade .  Owing to the requirement for enemy forces to reinforce their allies from \nthe sea, and as a result of the economies of most nations likely to threaten Red Alliance  \ninterests being largely dependent on seaborne trade, blockade may be employed to restrict \nenemy forces access to their own ports and to international straits.  A mixture of mines and \nFAC / FIAC swarm tactics are likely to be used to support this approach along with other \nsea denial tactics further out to sea.  \nSea Control is unlikely to be an end in itself but a set of conditions to be achieved in order to  \nachieve  a desired condition that will be limited in time, space and to the extent it is required.  \n62. Maritime Power Projection .  Amphibious forces , supplemented by merchant ships taken \nup from trade (STUFT) under contract , provide the principal means by which the Red Alliance  \ndelivers maritime power projection.  Additionally, the Russian / Soviet built destroyers and frigates \nare fitted with guns of sufficiently large calibre to deliver effective naval gunfire support (NGS) to \nforces ashore .  \nEdition 4 \n1-5-2 63. Maritime Manoeuvre .  The Red Alliance  does not consider maritime manoeuvre as a \nprinciple of maritime power in its own right, rather as the su m of the attributes of maritime forces.  \nThese attributes are universal and enduring and thus do not differ from those identified in Western \ndoctrine.  In sum, these are:  \na. Access .  Access guarantees freedom of navigation for maritime forces up to 12 \nnautical miles from a c oastline to allow options for intervention at a time and place of \nnational choosing.  \nb. Poise .  Poise is the ability of maritime forces to loiter in international waters , \ndemonstrating a forward military presence at readiness without the political and military \ncomplications and risks of deploying forces ashore or projecting from a third -party location.  \nc. Mobility .  Exploiting the access and freedom of navigation afforded by the sea, \nprovides maritime forces  with a high degree of mobility.  This facilitates maritime \nmanoeuvre and proves a deployable force that can reposition rapidly and cover significant \ndistances to respond to situations.  The capability of ‘lift capacity’  exploits the attribute of \nmobility to move large quantities of materiel by sea.  \nd. Persistence .  The endurance provided by on -board stocks, the ability to replenish \nat sea and operate at range from host -nation support provides a sustained presence unlike \nthat provided by any other military force.  The attribute of ‘persistence’ enables the \ncapability of ‘sustained reach’  which enables maritime forces to operate away from their \nhome base.  Persistence is enabled, in part, through the ‘resilience’  of maritime forces.  \ne. Versatility .  Maritime forces are uniquely versatile, easily changing their military \nposture, while undertaking several tasks concurrently and remaining available for rapid re -\ntasking.  Deploying with inherently high levels of readiness, a warship can transition from a \npeacetime state to a combat ready one in a matter of hours.  \nCollectively and individually these attributes deliver influence or the ability of Red Alliance  maritime \nforces  to have an effect on the behaviour of enemy forces at and in the vicinity of the sea.  \n64. Cover .  Cover is the provision of protection to units with less combat power or elements \nthat are operating in isolation, away from the main force .  The Red Alliance  maritime forces lack \nsome of the means to project power from the sea that are available to major ‘blue water’ navies but \nthey are capable of fighting in both the underwater and above water battlespaces.  They therefore \nhave the capability to provide limited force protection to vulnerable amphibious vessels and STUFT \nas well as to Mine Counter M easures Vessels (MCMVs) and to those involved in the laying of \nmines.   Maritime forces will expect the Red Alliance  air forces to provide defen ce against air attack \nthrough the provision of Combat Air Patrols (CAP) over maritime formations . \n65. The Maritime Security Role .  The Red Alliance  maritime forces principally contribute to \nmaritime security in the fields of Maritime Counter Terrorism (MCT), and through Maritime \nInterdiction Operations (MIO).  Tasks may include stopping, inspecting, seizing, and diverting \nsuspect ships and aircraft, and establishing and enforcing a maritime exclusion zone for the \nmaritime vessels of one or more parties to a conflict.  Maritime forces may also protect merchant \nshipping with flag -state consent that could otherwise be threatened.   The Red Alliance  mariti me \nforces may operate as part of a multi -national alliance but are more likely to operate unilaterally to \nprotect Red Alliance interests.  Other maritime security operations that  the Red Alliance  maritime \nforces may conduct include:  \na. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) .  Red Alliance  maritime \nforces have the reach and capabilities to provide HADR to countries in the vicinity of the \nArabian Gulf, Red Sea and potentially further afield to South Asia and West Africa.  This \ncapability has been developed both to assist friendly states and the home nations of the \nRed Alliance and to bolster the Alliance’s credibility on the world stage.  \nb. Freedom of Navigation Operations .  Red Alliance  maritime forces may be \nexpected to conduct freedom of navigation operations to uphold their perceived authority in \nthe Straits of Hormuz and to assert their right of innocent passage in the waters of other \nEdition 4 \n1-5-3 nations.  This may be conducted partly to reassure friendly states but also to coerce those \nless well disposed.  \n66. Peace Support Operations  (PSO) .  The Red Alliance  contribution to PSO is likely to be \nlimited to activities in countries where the Red Alliance states wish to reinforce or establish a \ndegree of influence.  In these situations, the maritime contribution is likely to be both limited and \nsolely in support of operations on land.  \n67. Defence Engagement .  As with PSO, Red Alliance  Defence Engagement is likely to be \ncarefully targeted at nations which the Red Alliance wishes to influence or where they wish to \nreinforce their presence.  Whilst vessels may well visit friendly ports to conduct defence diplomacy, \nthe Red Alliance ’s primary in volvement is likely to be in delivering training as an aspect of capacity \nbuilding in friendly nations and in defence sales to boost the economies of Red Alliance nations.  \nEdition 4 \n2-1-1 CHA PTER 2 \nORGANISATION AND EQUIPMENT  \nSECTION 1: ORGANISATION  OF LAND FORCES  \n1. Red Alliance Land Forces .  The land forces of the countries of the Red Alliance are \norganised and structured along very similar lines and follow the doctrine summarised in this \nhandbook.  Both countries’ land forces are based upon Combined Arms Armies which are \nmaintained at various states of readiness .  The basic ORBAT of the Red Alliance Land Component \nis shown on Page 2 -1-2 with t he detailed ORBATs  of the deployable forces shown in Pages 2 -1-3 \nand 2 -1-4.  The remaining  CAAs (2 CAA (Al Bwarh) and 4 CAA (Al Seel)) are non -deployable, \ninternal defence formations.  The generic structure of a CAA is on Page 2 -1-5 with the organisation \nof the Combined Arms Armies’ sub -formations shown in the subsequent  pages . \n2. Divisional Structure .  Red Alliance  divisions usually consist of 3 regiments (each \napproximately equivalent to an allied brigade ), either in a 2,1 or 1,2 construct  depending on \nwhether they are tank or motor rifle  divisions .  They have organic Combat Support and C ombat \nService Support  (see Pages 2 -1-6 to 2 -1-7), but are usually allocated additional assets when on \nthe main effort.  Direct support a viation assets from an Air Force Army Cooperation Squadron may  \nbe placed under the Tactical Command (TACOM) of the divisional commander .  A summary of \nforces found in divisional and lower formations may be found on Page 2 -1-8. \n3. Tank Divisions .  Tank divisions are best suited for exploitation roles in attack and for \ncounter attacks in defence and  are generally echeloned within the CAA accordingly.  They may be \nconfigured as Operational Manoeuvre Groups (at the operational level and seeking to destroy the \nenemy’s cohesion by acting throughout his depth).  Land -based OMGs will usually act well in \nadvance of the bulk of combat forces.   The ORBAT and equipment  of a generic tank division are \nshown on Pages 2 -1-9 and 2 -1-10. \n4. Motor Rifle  Divisions .  Motor Rifle Divisions  may contain a mix of wheeled  and tracked \nIFVs and APCs or  be mounted exclusively in one type.   The ORBAT and equipment’s  of a generic \nmotor rifle division are shown on Pages 2 -1-11 and 2 -1-12. \n5. Regiments .  The regiment is the basic tactical and administrative unit and the lowest level \nat which a truly Combined Arms capability exists.   The basic structure of Tank and Motor Rifle \nRegiments is shown on Page 2 -1-13 along with a detailed structure shown on pages 2 -1-14 and  \n2-1-15. \na. Motor Rifle Regiments (BMP Equipped) .  MRR equipped with BMP tracked Infantry \nFighting Vehicles will usually be on the divisional main effort and in the first echelon, though \nthey may be retained in the second echelon for the purposes of exploitation.   Each MRR \nwill normally contain 2 MR battalions equipped as shown on Page 2 -1-16 plus one tank \nbattalion (also on Page 2 -1-16). \nb. Motor Rifle Regiments (BTR Equipped) .  MRR equipped with BTR wheeled \nArmoured Personnel Carriers are more often employed in secondary sectors and generally \nprovide the infantry for heliborne operations if support helicopters  are a ttached  to the \ndivision.   Each MRR will normally contain 2 MR battalions equipped as shown on Page 2 -1-\n16 plus one tank battalion (also on Page 2 -1-16). \n6. Separate Tank and Motor Rifle Regiments .  ‘Separate’ is a designation used to describe \na unit or lower formation which is not part of the table of organisation and equipment of a larger \nformation but is used for conducting autonomous or independent actions.  Separate regiments and \nbattalions ena ble considerable flexibility in manoeuvre warfare but can only operate independently \nfor a relatively short time without additional support.  They might typically be used to  conduct raids \nin the enemy’s operational -tactical and operational depth, particularly during a defensive operation . \n \nEdition 4 \n2-1-2 RED ALLIANCE  LAND ORBAT  \n7. Red Alliance Land Component .  Al Bwarh and Al Seel each contribute a Combined Arms Army  (CAA)  to the Red Alliance wartime Land \nComponent as shown in the table below:  \n \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-3 8. Combined Arms Army ORBATs .  The ORBATs of the deployable CAAs are shown below:  \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-4  \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-5 9. Combined Arms Army Structure .  The basic structure of a CAA is shown below.  The precise organisation of the 4 CAAs will vary \ndependent on role and equipments:  \n \n(1) See Para 6.   \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-6 10. Combat Support in C ombined Arms Armies .  Combat Support for 1 CAA is shown below; a similar arrangement exists for 3 CAA.  \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-7 11. Combat Service Support (CSS) in Combined Arms Armies .  Each CAA has a Rear Support Group (RSG) plus one Forward Support Group \n(FSG) per Division.  In addition, each Division has a Divisional Support Group (DSG) .  Regimental Support Groups, one per Regiment, are shown  on \npage 2 -1-14. \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-8 \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-9  \n \n \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-10 SUMMARY OF MAJOR COMBAT EQUIPMENTS IN A TANK DIVISION  \n \n \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-11  \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-12 SUMMARY OF MAJOR COMBAT EQUIPMENTS IN A MOTOR RIFLE DIVISION  \n \n \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-13 \n6BASIC FORCES –  MR Regiment\n555A\n5(5;5)\n4D4R \nBASIC FORCES –  Tank Regiment4m 3[ \nCSS4 4W\n34S   \n3I  Def Pl\n6A \n55A\n5(5;\n4D4R 4m 3[ \nCSS4W\n33I  Def Pl5A5ARear\nSy Coy\n4 4S   Rear\nSy Coy\nEdition 4 \n2-1-14  \nNote: BTR Equipped MR Regiment has the same  structure  – For BTR MR Bn  orbat see Page 2 -1-16       \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-15  \n \n\nEdition 4 \n2-1-16  \n5BASIC FORCES – MR Bn BMP\nCombat Group Sp Weapons GroupBn HQ\nRecce\nSigs PlCSS\n4443  Mor\n3.MG\nAGL3    AD3      3R \n3m 3W\n3\n5A BASIC FORCES – Tank Bn in Tank Regiment\nBn HQ\nRecce\nSigs PlCSS\n4A 3R \n3m 3W\n3 Combat Group\n4A 4A \n5A BASIC FORCES – Tank Bn in MR Regiment\nBn HQ\nRecce\nSigs PlCSS\n4A 3R \n3m 3S 3W\n3 Combat Group\n4A 4A 4A 4A 3S 3S \n5% BASIC FORCES – MR Bn BTR\nCombat Group Sp Weapons GroupBn HQ\nRecce\nSigs PlCSS\n4% 4% 4% 3  Mor\n3.A-Tk\nAGL3    AD3     3R \n3m 3W\n33S \nEdition 4 \n2-2-1 SECTION 2 : LAND FORCE EQUIPMENT CHARACTERISTICS  \n12. Origins .  The Red Alliance  land forces are largely equipped with material of former -Soviet \nor Russian origin.  Historically the Soviet Union supported friendly and non -aligned states with \nmilitary hardware and expertise in order to counter Western influence in the Arabian Gulf and \nelsewhere.  This has continued largely unchanged since the demise of the Soviet Unio n with \nRussia being generally willing to provide military hardware to client states regardless of sanctions \nimposed by the United Nations.  More recently , the nations of the Red Alliance have started to look \nelsewhere for equipment and training,  but the la nd forces largely continue to use Russian \nequipment, albeit within a more manoeuvrist doctrine than previously.  \n13. Capabilities .  The characteristics of the equipment and weapons given in the following \nsection are drawn  from a variety of Russian and Western open sources.  Whilst all this equipment \nis available in the real world, it may not always be organised or employed in precisely t he \ncombinations or manner described in this document.   \n14. Nomenclature .  In general, the most commonly u nderstood  name for a piece of equipment \nis used throughout this and subsequent sections.  This will normally be the NATO reporting name , \nfor example the 9K35 Strela -10 short -range air defence system is described throughout as the SA -\n13 Gopher .  On occasions, however, where the NATO reporting name is not widely used, the \nRussian name is used instead.  For example, the Russian 152 mm towed howitzer is referred to as \nthe 2A65 Msta -B rather than its NATO name of M1987 in order to differentiate it from the 2S19 \nMsta -S, the self -propelled version (NATO:M1990 – Farm).  \n  \nEdition 4 \n2-2-2 LAND FORCE EQUIPMENT PHOTOGRAPHS AND SPECIFICATIONS  \nSURFACE TO SURFACE BALLISTIC MISSILES  \nSS-21 Scarab B (Tochka)  \n Type: Tactical Ballistic Missile  \nRange: 120 km  \nSpeed: Mach 5.3  \nMotor: Solid fuel rocket  \nWarhead: 450 kg fragmentation  \nGuidance: Inertial with MMW radar terminal \nguidance  \nNumbers:  \n• 2 to 3 missiles per launch vehicle  \n• 18 launchers per regiment  \nScud D \n Type: Tactical Ballistic Missile  \nRange: 700 km  \nSpeed: Mach 5  \nMotor: Liquid fuel rocket  \nWarhead: 985 kg fragmentation or HE  \nGuidance: Inertial with DSMAC radar terminal \nguidance  \nNumbers:  \n• 4 missiles per launch vehicle  \n• 12 or 18 launchers per regiment  \n \nMULTI BARRELLED ROCKET LAUNCHERS  \nBM-30 Smerch  \n Type: Heavy Multiple Rocket Launcher  \nRocket range: 25 to 70 km  \nCalibre: 300 mm  \nMotor: Solid fuel rocket  \nWarhead: 243 kg HE fragmentation  \nGuidance: Infra -red terminal guidance  \nNumbers:  \n• 12 plus 12 rockets  per launch vehicle  \n• 6 launchers per battalion  \n  \n\nEdition 4 \n2-2-3 BM-27 Uragan  \n Type: Self-propelled  Multiple Rocket Launcher  \nRocket range: 34 km \nCalibre: 220 mm  \nMotor: Solid fuel rocket  \nWarhead: 90 to 100  kg HE fragmentation  or \nscatterable mine sub -munitions  \nGuidance:  Unguided  \nNumbers:  \n• 16 plus 16 rockets  per launch vehicle  \n• 12 to 18 launchers per battalion  \nBM-21 Grad  \n Type: Self-propelled  Multiple Rocket Launcher  \nRocket range: 40 km \nCalibre: 122 mm \nMotor: Solid fuel rocket  \nWarhead: 21 kg HE fragmentation  or scatterable \nsub-munitions  \nGuidance:  Unguided  \nNumbers:  \n• 40 plus 60 rockets  per launch vehicle  \n• 18 launchers per battalion  \n \nSELF PROPELLED ARTILLERY  \n2S1 Gvozdika  \n Type: Self -propelled 122 mm Howitzer  \nRounds : 40 x HE or RAP  \nRange: HE – 15.3 km;

To meet the many demands made of air power , the Red Alliance  has divided their\nresources into 3 functional commands.  There is, however,  a degree of interchangeability between\nthe first two and multi -role aircraft  may be switched from one to the other as the situation requires.\nIn time of war this is particularly important as the campaign moves from Counter Air to Counter\nLand .\n16. Offensive Air Command (OAC) .  OAC  comprises all those Air Force assets  employed to\nreconnoitre and strike targets on the ground, together with  the ESM, escort and stand -off jamming\n(EJ and SOJ) aircraft which help them to reach their targets.   OAC includes a number of Army\nCooperation Squadrons dedicated to the support of the Land Commander but which remain under\nthe OPCOM of the Air Commander.\na.Army Cooperation Squadrons (AC Sqns) .  AC Sqns exist to provide the air\ndimension for the tactical battle.  Of course, OAC assets will also be used in this role for\nspecific phases of combat, but the Red Alliance  perceives the need for a dedicated\ncomponent to guarantee intimate air support at all times.  AC Sqns consist primarily of\nattack and transport helicopters but also includes day -only ground attack aircraft.\nb.Counter Sea .  Counter sea  operations may include strike missions in which the aircraft\ninvolved will be drawn from the OAC.\n17. Defensive Air Command (DAC) .  DAC  controls the air defence, air superiority  and\nAirborne Early Warning (AEW) and Control  aircraft which combat the air enemy in the air.   The\nlatter also control offensive aircraft and deconflict their actions with  those of defensive aviation.\nGround Based Air Defence (GBAD) missiles and Anti -Aircraft Artillery (AAA) come under DAC .\na.GBAD .  The Red Alliance ’s Integrated Air Defence System (IADS) falls within the\nDAC’s area of responsibility\nb.Counter Sea .  Counter sea  operations may include the provision of Combat Air Patrols\nover maritime formations in which the aircraft involved will be drawn from the DAC.\n18. Transport Command .  The Red Alliance ’s Transport Command comprises fixed wing\naircraft used for logistics  purposes , and the delivery of airborne forces and those rotary wing\ntransports required to support air operations.  Also coming under  Transport Command are the air-\nto-air refuelling (AAR) aircraft , though  operationally these support both OAC and DAC as required.\n(AAR is  seen to be an important force multiplier, extending the loiter time of aircraft  on CAPs or on\nairborne alert.  They also extend the range  of deep strike aircraft and their fighter protection,\nensuring that they will  not be inhibited from co nducting aerial manoeuvre through shortage of  fuel,\nand they enable a ircraft to operate at longer range.\nOPERATIONAL COMMAND  OF AIR FORCES  \n19. In wartime, a Red Alliance  Joint Military Commander will be appointed to command all\nforces allocated to the conflict.  He, in turn, will appoint an Air Commander who will be delegated\nOPCOM of the majority of air assets except those retained by the Maritime Commander .\nGenerally , this will be limited to as small number of ship -based aircraft.\nAIRCRAFT, WEAPONS AND FORCE STRUCTURING  \n20. Stand Off Weapons .  The problem of destroying targets in the enemy’s depth  in the face\nof sophisticated fighter and SAM opposition is approached in a  number of different ways.   One w ay\nof reducing risk and therefore attrition  is seen to lie in long -range weapons including the ground\nlaunched cruise missiles (GLCM) and theatre ballistic missiles (TBM)  operated by the land forces .\nWith a low radar cross  section and a terrain hugging capability, GLCM a re difficult to intercept and\ndestroy with either air or ground based defences.  Other stand -off weapons in the form of radiation\nhoming missiles (ARM)  are used against the fire control radars  of threat SAMs themselves to\nsuppress  air defences on the approaches to targets and to destroy AWACS.   The delivery platform\ncan engage its target without entering the engagement zone of the enemy’s fighters or dense SAM\ndefences.  In some cases, it will not even be necessary to leave friendly airspace to launch such\nEdition 4 \n2-3-2 ‘fire and forget’ weapons.  The cost  of precision weaponry being very high, it can only be provided \nin relatively  limited quantities to deal with the most problematical targets.  Therefore, most  \nmissions, at least in the tactical zone, will still have to be accomplished  using free fall (including \nretard) bombs and cluster munitions which require  aircraft to overfly the target.  \n21. Offensive Aircraft .  The Red Alliance  recogni ses that, while SAM  defences can be \navoided, or at least exposure to them limited, by careful  routing and low flying, enemy fighters \ncannot easily be evaded if controlled  by AWACS .  AWACS has effectively closed the gap beneath \nground -based  radars which in the past was exploited by attack aircraft, thus forcing the  latter to \nfight their way to and from the target rather than try to avoid the  defence. Fighter -bomber design \ntherefore stresses high speed and  manoeuvrability,  and such aircraft now carry short range air to \nair missi les (AAM ) for self -protection  as well as offensive stores.  There is, in fact, less and less \ndifference  in performance between advanced fighter -bombers and fighters, with either  being \nusable (albeit with some limitations) in the other role . \n22. Support Aircraft .  Given that little will escape the AWACS eye in the sky,  offensive aircraft \nare likely to have to fight their way to their target (and back  again).  They will often need fighter \nescorts and will always require EW  support.  The Red Alliance  does not rely solely on self -\nprotection ECM pods and  decoys carried by attack aircraft.  They are supplemented by large SOJ  \nplatforms which operate from the safety of their own airspace and are escorted  by EJ aircraft \n(which may not only jam ground and airborne intercept radars  and engage them with ARMs but \nalso lay very long, slow -fall chaff trails to  conceal the size of raids and the location of individual \naircraft within them).  \n23. Fighters .  The trend in the Red Alliance  is to purchase fighters with long-range  / loiter \ntimes and t hat can carry a large inventory of AAMs for different types of engagement.  It also  \nreflects a growing stress on BVR engagements, including those using long  range  and look -down, \nshoot -down radars and missiles, in preference to dog  fighting.  Nonetheless , the latter is not \nneglected,  and fighters always carry both  short range, all aspect AAMs and a 30  mm cannon for \nclose -in fights.  \n24. AWACS .  Both airspace management and air defence are crucially  dependent on the Red \nAlliance ’s small number of AWACS platforms.  \n25. Army Cooperation .  The Red Alliance  continues to emphasi se the importance of a  sturdy, \nsurvivable ground attack aircraft capable of delivering a heavy weight  of ordnance in the tactical \ndepth.  Advanced inertial navigation systems  enable such aircraft to deliver attacks accurately from \nvery low level against  targets whose location is known in advance and optronic target acquisition  / \naiming systems aid surprise attacks by eliminating active systems.   In attack  helicopter design, \nthree trends are discernible .  One is to provide a fire  support helicopter thought of and described \nas ‘flying artillery ’.  The second  takes the shape of a well-armed  vehicle that can carry an infantry \nsection,  known as a ‘flying BMP ’.  Such aircraft are to be seen in growing numbers in  association \nwith air assault units.  The third is a rotary wing ‘fighter ’ with the  ability to engage both ground and \nair targets, and with the agility to engage  in dog fights with enemy helicopters.  As attack \nhelicopters are now required  to operate throughout the enemy’s tactical depth (by night as well as \nday) and not just along the line of contact, they now carry the same protective  features as ground \nattack aircraft (eg armour against 20  mm cannon fire,  RWRs and radar and IR decoys) .  They too \nhave inertial navigation and  optronic targeting and sighting systems (using mast -mounted sights) \nand laser target acquisition and marking systems.  \nAIRCREW  \n26. Manning .  Expensive and thus scarce assets must be fully utili sed.  The Red Alliance  \nseeks to  establish an aircrew to aircraft ratio of 2:1 for all weather,  day and night aircraft and 1.5:1 \nfor day only aircraft in order to achieve  sustainability.  \n27. Training .  Whilst t he Red Alliance  has greatly improved the selection procedures for  \naircrew and the quality of flight instruction and training , training is still limited to an average of 75 \nhours per annum for combat aircrew.  Fighter  and fighter -bomber crews are cross trained so that \nthey can perform  adequately in their secondary role.  \n \nEdition 4 \n2-3-3 RED ALLIANCE  AIR BASES  \nAL BWARH AIR BASES  \nSerial  AIRBASE  CODE  LAT / \nLONG  HARDENED \nSHELTERS  MINIMUM \nOPERATING \nSTRIP  AIRCRAFT  \n      TYPE  NO \n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) \n1  AL FATHAH  ORAF  35.135N \n43.725E  0 2 An-12 25 \n2  TALIL  ORTL  30.941N \n46.085E  15 4 Su-25  20 \n3  WADI AL KHIRR  ORWK  31.417N  \n43.182E  12 4 Su-25  20 \n4  BALAD \nSOUTHEAST  (AL \nBAKR)  ORBD  33.933N \n44.367E  40 4 Su-27 40 \n5  AL NAJAF  ORNI  31.990N \n44.404E   1 \n Mi-24  \nMi-17P  30 \n30 \n6  AL ASAD AB  ORAA  33.800N \n42.433E  30 4 Su-27 40 \n7  BAGHDAD INTL  ORBI  33.263N \n44.234E  6 6 Su-34 \nIL-78 \nHoveyzeh  30 \n4 \n20 \n8  MOSUL  ORBM  36.306N \n43.148E  -

In peacetime the maritime forces of the nations of the Red Alliance operate to meet the\npriorities of their national governments .  There is a standing Red Alliance  maritime headquarters,\nthe principal role of which is to plan for war.   Subsidiary maritime headquarters are established in\nAl Bwarh and Al Seel to exercise peacetime command of national forces, and for warfighting .\n29. Al Seel .  Al Seel has invested heavily in its maritime forces though the Navy remains very\nmuch the junior service.  Its equipment is sourced from a wide range of nations, sometimes in\ndefiance of sanctions through the use of third parties, and contains a mix of Western  and former -\nSoviet platforms and technologies though the majority comes from the former Soviet Union and its\nsuccessor states.  In recent times, they have become adept at seamlessly integrating these\ndifferent technologies and their ships and submar ines now differ significantly from their original\nstate as delivered from their suppliers.  The peacetime Order of Battle (ORBAT) of A l Seel’s\nmaritime forces is shown on Page 2 -5-4.\n30. Al Bwarh .  Al Bwarh maritime forces have been developed with the assistance of Al Seel\nand contain a mix of platforms and technologies from east and west though.  As with Al Seel, the\nmajority is from the former Soviet Union and its successor states .  Personnel are largely trained in\nAl Seel facilities and most operational sea training of maritime units is conducted in Al Seel naval\nfacilities under the auspices of Al Seel personnel.  As a result, all Al Bwarh maritime forces are\ncompletely interoper able wi th their Al Seel allies.   The peacetime ORBAT of A l Bwarh ’s maritime\nforces is shown on Page 2 -5-3.\nOPERATIONS DURING CONFLICT  \n31. The Red Alliance  maritime forces are conf igured to deliver the warfighting role through\ncontrol of the sea limited in time, space and to the degree required to deny its use to the enemy.\nTo that end , in wartime they are force packaged into a single Maritime Component as shown on\nPage 2 -5-4.  The Maritime Component is commanded from the standing Red Alliance  Maritime\nHeadquarters.\n32. Red Alliance  Maritime Component .  The Red Alliance  Maritime Component is organised\nin a manner that will be recognisable to Gold Alliance maritime planners and profession als though\nthe terminology may be different  (See Page 2 -5-5).  The Maritime Component operates as a single\nunified maritime Task Force which is sub -divided in to 4 Task Groups:\na.The Amphibious Force .  The Amphibious Force contains 2 sub -formations: 1 Al Seel\nMarine Regiment  which would normally make up the majority of the Landing Force, and the\nAmphibious Shipping.  The Amphibious Shipping comprises a mix of specialist amphibious\ntransports: one LPD, one LPH and 4 LSLs , plus 4 STUFT which are Government Owned\nand Contractor Operated (GOCO ) and  have civilian crews.   The majority of the amphibious\ncapability belongs to Al Seel but Al Bwarh’s single LSL plus its 3 Ro Ro / Ro Pax vesse ls\ngives it a limited capability to operate independently.\nb.The Mine Counter Measures (MCM) Force .  The MCM Force contains 2 MCM\nSquadrons, one from Al Bwarh with 3 minesweepers, and one from Al Seel with 6\nminesweepers.  All the minesweepers are single role vessels equipped with both\nmechanical and influence sweeps .  As such, they are capable of dealing with the types of\nmines laid during recent conflicts in the Arabian Gulf but would struggle against a more\nsophisticated mine threat.\nc.The Strike Force .  The Strike Force is organised into 2 sub -formations: the major units\ncomprising destroyers, frigates and the replenishment ship, and the extensive FAC / FIAC\nforce.\n(1) Major Units .  The roles of the major units include the provision of ‘cover’ to\nthe amphibious force, and to form Surface Action Groups (SAGs) to take the fight to\nthe enemy, most probably in the open waters of the Sea of Oman and the Arabian\nSea.  Al Bwarh operates one destroyer and 2 frigates; Al Seel possesses 2\ndestroyers and 3 frigates.  The capabilities of the Al Bwarh and the Al Seel vessels\nEdition 4 \n2-5-2are very similar with no obvious differences in either equipment fit or readiness \nposture.  Only Al Seel possess a replenishment ship, a former British Rover class \nlight fleet tanker which has the ability to resupply fuel oils and a limited quantity of \nother stores.  \n(2) FAC / FIAC .  The Fast Attack Craft are relatively heavily armed high-speed\nvessels and are designed to operate in numbers to overwhelm enemy defences and\nlaunch missiles and torpedoes against enemy surface units close to shore.  The\nFast Inshore Attack Craft operate in a similar manner but are both more numerous\nand much more lightly arm ed.  The FIAC deploy in swarms with the aim of denying\nthe enemy access to choke points such as the Straits of Hormuz close to where\nthey are based.  Al Bwarh operate s 2 squ adrons of FAC armed with missiles whilst\nAl Seel operates one, and both nations have a single squadron  of torpedo -armed\nFAC.  Al Seel only operates 2 squadrons of FIAC.\nd.Submarines .  Al Seel operates 3 former -Soviet Kilo class conventional submarines\n(SSK).  Whilst highly effective sea denial weapons, the principal effect delivered by the\nSSKs is to act as a ‘fleet -in-being’  tying up large numbers of enemy surface, sub -surface\nand air resources in trying to detect and prosecute attacks against them.  Al Seel Naval\nOfficers are known to have studies extensively the role of Argentinian SSKs during the\nFalklands  Conflict  of 1982  and are expected to seek to achieve the same eff ect in any\nfuture conflict.\n33. Readiness and Training .  Red Alliance  maritime forces are kept at a high degree of\nreadiness.  Al Seel in particular has an extensive maritime support infrastructure to maintain its\nvessels, the use of which it extends to the maritime forces of Al Bwarh.  Units of both forces train\nregularly together and independently; in recent times, more trust appears to be being placed in\nmore junior commanders who are permitted to exercise a limited degree of mission command,\nreflecting a more manoeuvrist approach by t he high commands of both nations.  It is not known\nhow effective this will prove in reality; the armed forces of both nations were built up along the\nSoviet model.\nEdition 4 \n2-5-3RED ALLIANCE  MARITIME ORBAT SUMMARY CHARTS  \nAL
